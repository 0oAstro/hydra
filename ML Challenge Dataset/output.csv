Spatial reasoning,"You have four rods of different lengths: 8 cm, 5 cm, 12 cm, and 3 cm. You must create a three-dimensional shape with all four rods so that each rod is connected to two others at its ends, forming a closed structure with triangular faces. How many distinct shapes can you form, considering that two shapes are distinct if they cannot be rotated or mirrored to look identical?","Step­ 1.  Interpret the “shape” as a closed 4-rod loop (every rod meets two others, one at each end), i.e. a quadrilateral frame whose sides are the rods.  
Step­ 2.  Label the rods by their lengths 3, 5, 8, 12 and ask: how many ways can we arrange these four distinct edges around a 4-cycle, up to rigid motions and reflections?  
Step­ 3.  The number of distinct cyclic orderings of n labeled items, with flips identified, is  
      (n – 1)! / 2.  
      Here n = 4, so we get (4–1)!/2 = 3!/2 = 6/2 = 3.  
Step­ 4.  Each of those three inequivalent orderings yields a non-self-crossing quadrilateral in space (it can be folded in 3D) and no two of them can be made to coincide by rotation or by mirroring.  

Hence there are exactly 3 distinct closed shapes.

Lateral thinking,"A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him underwater for five minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But 5 minutes later, they both go out and enjoy a lovely dinner together. How can this be?","Step-by-step reasoning  
1. At first glance “shoots her husband,” “holds him underwater,” and “hangs him” sound like violent acts leading to murder.  
2. Yet five minutes later the couple happily goes out to dinner—so the husband can’t have been killed.  
3. This suggests the verbs are being used in a non-literal sense.  
4. In photography you “shoot” with a camera, then “hold” the developing print in liquid (developer or fixer), and finally “hang” the photo to dry.  
5. Once the photo is developed, both people (the photographer and her subject, the husband) are perfectly fine and can go to dinner together.

Classic riddles,You are in a race and you overtake the second person. What position are you in now?,"Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Before overtaking, you must have been immediately behind the person in second place, so you were in third place.
2. You overtake the person who is in second place.
3. By passing them, you take their position (second), and they drop to third.
4. The person who was in first remains in first.

Therefore, after overtaking the second‐place runner, you are now in second place.

Operation of mechanisms,"In a factory, there are three machines A, B, and C. Machine A polishes items, Machine B engraves them and Machine C performs a quality check. Every item must go through all three processes. The time taken by the machines is different: A takes 3 minutes per item, B takes 4 minutes per item, and C takes 2 minutes per item. Given that each machine can only handle one item at a time, in what order should the items be processed so that the maximum number of items are completed in 60 minutes?","Step 1: Identify the processing times and the fact that this is a permutation flow‐shop with identical jobs.  
  – pA = 3 min, pB = 4 min, pC = 2 min.  
  – Every job must visit each machine once; we may choose any machine order (no blocking or transport delays assumed).  

Step 2: Compute the average cycle time once the pipeline is full.  
  – The “bottleneck” is the slowest machine, which is B at 4 min.  
  – After the first job has gone through all three machines (which takes 3+4+2=9 min), a new job will finish every 4 min.  

Step 3: Compute how many jobs finish within 60 min.  
  – First job finishes at t=9 min.  
  – Each additional job finishes each 4 min thereafter.  
  – So if k jobs finish by t=60:  
       9 + (k−1)·4 ≤ 60  
       (k−1)·4 ≤ 51  
       k−1 ≤ 12.75  
       k ≤ 13.75 ⇒ kmax=13  

Step 4: Observe that neither the sum of processing times (9 min) nor the bottleneck time (4 min) depends on the order in which A, B, and C are arranged.  Hence every permutation yields exactly 13 completed items in 60 min.

Conclusion: No fixed ordering of A, B, C outperforms any other – the throughput is 13 jobs in 60 min regardless of sequence. This is not among options 1–4, so we choose “another answer.”

CORRECT ANSWER: 5",5
Operation of mechanisms,"You have three seemingly identical machines, each with a single button on top. One of the machines is programmed to always dispense a gold coin when its button is pressed, another is programmed to always dispense a silver coin, and the third machine is programmed to randomly dispense either a gold coin or nothing. You don't have any coins to start with. Your task is to determine the mechanism of each machine by pushing their buttons as few times as possible, but there's a catch: After you push a button, there is a cooling-off period where you must wait 15 minutes before you can push any button again. What is the fewest number of times you have to press the buttons to be certain of each machine's operation?","Here is the key insight:

· A silver coin can only come from the “always‐silver” machine (call it S).  
· A “nothing” result can only come from the “random” machine (call it R).  
· A gold coin can come from either the “always‐gold” machine (call it G) or R.

Strategy sketch: You press machines until you see a “silver” (identifies S) and a “nothing” (identifies R); the remaining machine must be G. But R may—by pure bad luck—keep spitting out gold forever, in which case every press on it looks exactly like G. No finite number of gold‐only observations can distinguish “always‐gold” from “random‐but‐so‐far‐all‐gold.” You only become certain that a machine is R when you actually observe a “nothing.” In the worst case that might never happen in any finite sequence of presses.

Therefore there is no finite upper bound on the number of presses needed to be 100% certain.  

CORRECT ANSWER: 4",4
Sequence solving,"You are presented with a sequence of numbers that represent the number of dots in a series of images: 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ? You have to figure out the principle that generates the sequence. What is the number represented by the question mark?","1. First, list the given sequence and compute the successive differences  
   Sequence: 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ?  
   Differences:  
   5 – 1 = 4  
   12 – 5 = 7  
   22 – 12 = 10  
   35 – 22 = 13  

2. Observe that the differences themselves form an arithmetic progression  
   4, 7, 10, 13, …  
   which increases by 3 each time.  

3. Predict the next difference by continuing that progression  
   Next difference = 13 + 3 = 16  

4. Add that to the last known term  
   Next term = 35 + 16 = 51  

Therefore, the missing number is 51, which corresponds to option 3.

Optimization of actions and planning,"Alice is planning her work schedule for the week. She has 3 tasks to complete: Task A takes 4 hours, Task B takes 3 hours, and Task C takes 2 hours. She can work a maximum of 5 hours per day. She has personal commitments on Wednesday, so she can't work more than 2 hours. What is the minimum number of days Alice needs to finish all tasks if she wants to dedicate entire work blocks to a single task and not split any task across days?","1. Identify tasks and durations:
   - Task A: 4 h  
   - Task B: 3 h  
   - Task C: 2 h  

2. Daily work limits:
   - Any normal day: up to 5 h  
   - Wednesday: up to 2 h  

3. Constraints:
   - No task may be split across days.  
   - Multiple whole tasks may be done in one day so long as the sum of their durations does not exceed the daily limit.  

4. Packing tasks to minimize days:
   - Combine Task B (3 h) and Task C (2 h) on one 5 h day.  
   - Complete Task A (4 h) on a second day (4 h ≤ 5 h).  
   - All tasks are finished in 2 days, and there is no need to work on Wednesday.  

Therefore, the minimum number of days required is 2.

Spatial reasoning,"You have a 10x10x10 cube made up of 1x1x1 smaller cubes. The large cube is painted red on all of the outside surfaces. If the 10x10x10 cube is broken into the individual 1x1x1 cubes, how many of the smaller cubes will have red paint on exactly two sides?","1. Let N = 10 be the side-length of the big cube in small-cube units.  
2. A small cube has exactly two painted faces precisely when it lies on an edge of the big cube but is not a corner.  
3. Each edge of the big cube has N = 10 small cubes along it; removing the 2 corners leaves 10 – 2 = 8 “edge-only” cubes per edge.  
4. A cube has 12 edges, so the total number of small cubes with exactly two painted faces is 12 × 8 = 96.

Optimization of actions and planning,"Four friends are planning to attend a series of events in a single day. They want to maximize the total number of different events they can attend. The schedule is as follows: Event A (09:00-11:00), Event B (10:30-12:30), Event C (11:15-13:15), and Event D (12:45-14:45). Assume traveling time between events is negligible and each friend can attend an event from the beginning to the end only if they don't overlap. What is the maximum number of different events the group can attend in total if they split up optimally and each event requires at least one of them to be present?","Step 1: List the events with their time‐intervals  
  A : 09 :00–11 :00  
  B : 10 :30–12 :30  
  C : 11 :15–13 :15  
  D : 12 :45–14 :45  

Step 2: Note which events overlap  
  – A and B overlap from 10 :30 to 11 :00  
  – A and C do *not* overlap (A ends at 11 :00, C starts at 11 :15)  
  – B and C overlap from 11 :15 to 12 :30  
  – B and D do *not* overlap (B ends at 12 :30, D starts at 12 :45)  
  – C and D overlap from 12 :45 to 13 :15  

Step 3: Check the maximum number of simultaneously running events  
  – The busiest moment is when two events overlap (no time slot has three or four events overlapping).  

Step 4: Assign friends to cover all events  
  We have four friends, so at any point we can station up to four people. Since at most two events run at once, it is easily possible to send different friends to each overlapping event. For example:  
    • Friend 1 attends A (09–11) then C (11 :15–13 :15)  
    • Friend 2 attends B (10 :30–12 :30) then D (12 :45–14 :45)  
    • Friends 3 and 4 remain on standby (or cover duplicates if desired)  

This schedule covers A, B, C, and D, i.e. all 4 different events. Since there are only 4 events total, the group cannot exceed 4 unique events.

Classic riddles,"A wealthy book collector dies and leaves a will stating that his gold shall be shared among his three sons. According to the will, the eldest son will get half of the gold coins, the middle son will get one-third, and the youngest will get one-ninth. The book collector had 17 gold coins. To prevent them from melting down or damaging the coins to divide them, how can the sons divide the gold fairly according to the will's conditions?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The will demands that out of the total coins, the eldest gets 1/2, the middle 1/3, and the youngest 1/9.
2. With only 17 coins, 17·(1/2)=8.5, 17·(1/3)≈5.67, 17·(1/9)≈1.89—none of these are whole coins.
3. The classic trick is to “borrow” 1 extra coin (making 18) so that each fraction becomes a whole number:
   - Eldest: 1/2 of 18 = 9  
   - Middle: 1/3 of 18 = 6  
   - Youngest: 1/9 of 18 = 2  
4. Total distributed = 9 + 6 + 2 = 17.  
5. The borrowed 1 coin is then returned, and each son has received the exact fraction required without cutting or melting any coins.

Sequence solving,"You're shown a sequence of numbers that appear to be increasing unpredictably: 2, 5, 10, 17, 26. You need to figure out the rule that governs the sequence to predict the next two numbers. What are the sixth and seventh numbers in this sequence?","1. First, observe the given sequence and compute the successive differences:
   • 5 – 2 = 3  
   • 10 – 5 = 5  
   • 17 – 10 = 7  
   • 26 – 17 = 9  

2. These differences are odd numbers increasing by 2 each time (3, 5, 7, 9,…).  
   • The next difference should be 11, so the sixth term is 26 + 11 = 37.  
   • The following difference should be 13, so the seventh term is 37 + 13 = 50.

3. Alternatively, one can note that the nth term is n² + 1:  
   • 1²+1=2, 2²+1=5, 3²+1=10, 4²+1=17, 5²+1=26, hence 6²+1=37 and 7²+1=50.

Therefore, the sixth and seventh terms are 37 and 50, which corresponds to option 1.

CORRECT ANSWER: 1",1
Sequence solving,"Imagine you encounter a bizarre sequence of numbers where each number depends on the one before it. The sequence begins with the number 2, and the rule to find the next number is to sum the digits of the square of the current number. The beginning of the sequence is as follows: 2, 4, 16, 7, 49, 16, 7... What is the 10th number in the sequence?","Step-by-step (using “next = sum of the digits of (current)²”):

1. a₁ = 2  
2. Square 2 → 4; sum its digits → 4.  ⇒ a₂ = 4  
3. Square 4 → 16; sum its digits → 1+6 = 7. ⇒ a₃ = 7  
4. Square 7 → 49; sum its digits → 4+9 = 13. ⇒ a₄ = 13  
5. Square 13 → 169; sum its digits → 1+6+9 = 16. ⇒ a₅ = 16  
6. Square 16 → 256; sum its digits → 2+5+6 = 13. ⇒ a₆ = 13  
7. Square 13 → 169; sum its digits → 16. ⇒ a₇ = 16  
8. Square 16 → 256; sum its digits → 13. ⇒ a₈ = 13  
9. Square 13 → 169; sum its digits → 16. ⇒ a₉ = 16  
10. Square 16 → 256; sum its digits → 13. ⇒ a₁₀ = 13  

So from n=4 onward the terms alternate 13,16. Thus the 10th term is 13, which is answer choice 3.

Spatial reasoning,"In a room, there are 4 corner tables shaped as quarter-circles. Each table fits perfectly in each corner of the room. If you put them together, they form a full circle. One day, the tables were rearranged to form a new shape - a square with an empty space in the middle. The side of the square formed by the tables is twice the length of each side of the original square room. What is the ratio of the area of the empty space in the middle of the tables to the area of one table?","1. Let the original square room have side length s. Each table is a quarter-circle of radius s, so its area is (π s²)/4.

2. When rearranged, the tables form a square of side 2s, and the empty central region is exactly the square minus the 4 quarter-disks:
   Empty area = (2s)² – 4·(π s²/4) = 4s² – π s² = s²(4 – π).

3. The ratio of empty area to one table’s area is
   [s²(4 – π)] / [π s²/4] = 4(4 – π)/π = (16 – 4π)/π = 16/π – 4.

This matches answer option 2.

Lateral thinking,Emma has been captured and she only has one chance to escape. The kidnapper tells her she can leave if she figures out the pattern and fills in the blank correctly. He gives her a piece of paper with the sequence: 'JFMAMJJASON_D'. What letter should Emma write in the blank to escape?,"Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Observe the string of letters: J F M A M J J A S O N _ D  
2. Note that the first eleven letters are the initial letters of the months January through November:
   J = January  
   F = February  
   M = March  
   A = April  
   M = May  
   J = June  
   J = July  
   A = August  
   S = September  
   O = October  
   N = November  
3. The next slot (the blank) must be the first letter of December, which is “D.”  
4. The final “D” shown completes December’s “D” (sometimes puzzles double-list to emphasize the wrap).  

Therefore Emma should write “D,” which corresponds to option 3.  

CORRECT ANSWER: 3",3
Spatial reasoning,"Imagine a cube that is painted red on all its faces and is then cut into 27 identical smaller cubes. These smaller cubes are mixed up with identical cubes of the same size that have never been painted. If the ratio of painted to unpainted smaller cubes is 2:1, how many of the smaller cubes have exactly two red faces exposed?","1. First, list how many small cubes from the original painted 3×3×3 cube have k painted faces:
   - 3 painted faces (corners): 8  
   - 2 painted faces (edge-centers): 12  
   - 1 painted face (face-centers): 6  
   - 0 painted faces (the very center): 1  
   Total 27 cubes.

2. “Painted” here means at least one red face, so there are 8+12+6 = 26 painted cubes. The one interior cube has 0 red faces, so is unpainted along with any added blanks.

3. They mix in extra unpainted cubes so that painted : unpainted = 2 : 1. Let x be the extra blanks. Then  
   painted : unpainted = 26 : (1+x) = 2 : 1  
   ⇒ 26 = 2(1 + x) ⇒ 26 = 2 + 2x ⇒ 2x = 24 ⇒ x = 12.

4. The question asks for the count of small cubes with exactly two red faces—that is exactly the edge-center cubes from the original, which is 12.

Operation of mechanisms,"A new clock has been designed to use a special mechanism where each of the three gears (A, B, and C) engage with each other in a linear sequence (A engages with B, B engages with C). Gear A rotates clockwise, and each gear has a different number of teeth: Gear A has 40 teeth, Gear B has 55 teeth, and Gear C has 70 teeth. If gear A makes one full rotation clockwise, how many rotations and in which direction will gear C complete?","1. Step-by-step reasoning  
   a. When two gears mesh, they rotate in opposite directions and the ratio of their rotations equals the inverse ratio of their tooth counts:  
      θ₂ = –(N₁/N₂)·θ₁,  
      where N₁, N₂ are tooth counts of driving and driven gears, θ₁, θ₂ their rotation angles, and the minus sign denotes reversal of direction.  
   b. First, A drives B:  
      N_A = 40, N_B = 55, θ_A = +1 rotation (clockwise).  
      θ_B = –(N_A/N_B)·θ_A = –(40/55)·1 = –40/55 = –8/11 rotations.  
      The negative sign means B turns 8/11 of a rotation counterclockwise.  
   c. Next, B drives C:  
      N_B = 55, N_C = 70, θ_B = –8/11 rotations (CCW).  
      θ_C = –(N_B/N_C)·θ_B = –(55/70)·(–8/11) = +(55·8)/(70·11) = 4/7 rotations.  
      The positive sign means C turns 4/7 of a rotation in the same sense as A, i.e. clockwise.  

2. Therefore, gear C makes 4/7 rotations clockwise.

Classic riddles,You arrive at a fork in the road and find a pair of identical twin sisters standing there. One sister always tells the truth and the other always lies. You can ask just one question to either sister to figure out which road leads to the city. What question should you ask?,"Here’s the classic analysis:

1. Label the sisters T (truth‐teller) and L (liar). One road (call it “Left”) goes to the city; the other (“Right”) does not.  
2. You ask one sister, “What road would your sister say is the one to the city?”  
   - If you ask T: she knows L always lies. L would point you to the wrong road (Right). T truthfully reports “Right.”  
   - If you ask L: she knows T always tells the truth. T would point you to the correct road (Left). L must lie about that, so she also says “Right.”  
3. In either case you hear “Right,” so you take the opposite road (“Left”), which is the city road.

Thus the question you should ask is exactly option 1.

Lateral thinking,"Alice, Bob, and Charlie are trapped in a room with two doors. One door leads to freedom, but the other door leads to a room full of traps that is unavoidable once someone enters. There is no indication of which door is which. In the room, there is a computer that allows them to ask one yes-or-no question. The computer will answer truthfully, but it will turn off after one question. They need to figure out which door to take without risking anyone's life. What single question can they ask the computer to ensure they pick the correct door to freedom?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We have two doors, one “freedom” door and one “trap” door.  
2. The computer will answer one yes-or-no question truthfully.  
3. A single direct yes-no question about either door’s status is sufficient to identify the safe door.  
4. For example: “Is the left door the one that leads to freedom?”  
   - If the computer answers “Yes,” they take the left door.  
   - If the computer answers “No,” they take the right door.  
5. No further trickery or nested hypotheticals is needed, since the computer never lies and will answer truthfully.

Spatial reasoning,"Four friends are at corners of a large square field and want to reach the exact center of the field at the same time. Each of them starts walking at the same time with the same walking speed but each takes a different straight path. The paths are as follows: Friend A walks directly towards the center, Friend B walks diagonally to the opposite corner and then takes a 90-degree turn towards the center, Friend C walks to the midpoint of one of the edges of the square and then walks parallel to another edge to reach the center, and Friend D takes a path that first heads to the center of an adjacent edge and then directly towards the center. Assuming they all walk at a constant speed, which friend would need to walk the fastest to reach the center at the same time as the others?","1. Let the square have side length L and center at the point that is L/2 from each side.  
2. Compute each friend’s total path length:

  Friend A (directly towards center):  
    Distance = √[(L/2)² + (L/2)²] = (L√2)/2 ≈ 0.707 L  

  Friend B (to opposite corner then to center):  
    First leg (corner to opposite corner) = L√2  
    Second leg (that corner to center) = (L√2)/2  
    Total = L√2 + (L√2)/2 = (3/2)·L√2 ≈ 2.121 L  

  Friend C (to midpoint of one edge, then parallel to another edge):  
    First leg = L/2  
    Second leg = L/2  
    Total = L  

  Friend D (to midpoint of adjacent edge, then straight‐line to center):  
    First leg = L/2  
    Second leg = √[(L/2)² + (L/2)²] = (L√2)/2  
    Total = L/2 + (L√2)/2 = (1 + √2)/2 · L ≈ 1.207 L  

3. Ranking path lengths: B (≈2.121 L) > D (≈1.207 L) > C (1 L) > A (≈0.707 L).  
4. To arrive simultaneously at the same walking‐time T, speed = distance/T, so the longest path (Friend B) requires the highest speed.

Spatial reasoning,An ant is located at one corner of a 10 x 10 x 10 cube. It needs to crawl to the diagonally opposite corner in the shortest possible path without crossing any of the cube's faces. What is the minimum surface distance the ant must travel?,"Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Label the cube’s side length L = 10.  We want the shortest path on the surface from A = (0,0,0) to B = (L,L,L).

2. Any surface path can be “unfolded” into the plane by cutting along edges.  The shortest route will traverse exactly two faces (if you try to use three faces you get a longer rectangle).

3. Pick the two adjacent faces that meet along an edge between a face of A and a face of B.  When you unfold those two faces into one flat rectangle, the start and end points become opposite corners of a  L×(2L)  rectangle.

4. The straight‐line distance in that rectangle is  
   √[ (2L)² + (L)² ]  
   = √[4L² + L²]  
   = √(5L²)  
   = L√5.

5. Plug in L = 10:  distance = 10√5 ≈ 22.36, which is not one of the first four numerical options.

Therefore the correct choice is “Another answer.”

Spatial reasoning,"A builder has a set of 5 differently shaped blocks: a cube, a sphere, a pyramid, a cylinder, and a cone. He places all of them in a row but notices that when viewed from the top, three particular shapes align perfectly such that their top surfaces form a straight line. Which three shapes are these and in what order do they appear in the row? Note that the cylinder's height is twice its diameter, the cone's height is equal to the diameter of its base, and the cube side length is equal to the diameter of the sphere.","1. Reasoning  
- The puzzle hinges on matching the vertical “top‐heights” of solid objects so that, when you look from the side (or equivalently imagine their rooflines viewed in profile), the apices/flat tops of three of them lie exactly on one straight (horizontal) line.  
- We know:  
  • The sphere’s height (its diameter) = D.  
  • The cube’s side = D, so its top face sits at height D.  
  • The cone’s height = its base diameter; if we choose that base diameter = D, then the cone’s apex is also at height D.  
- No other shape in the set can be forced to height D by the data given (the cylinder must be 2× its own diameter, and the pyramid’s height is unspecified), so the only three that can be made to share the same top‐height D are:  
    Sphere, Cube, and Cone  
- In a row, those three will have their highest points all at the same elevation, hence their top surfaces “line up” on one straight (horizontal) line.

2. Which option?  
None of the four listed triples is exactly “Sphere–Cube–Cone.”  Therefore the correct choice is the fifth entry: “Another answer.”

1. A 4×4×4 cube has 64 unit cubes in all.  
2. Cubes with exactly three painted faces are the 8 corners.  
3. Cubes with exactly two painted faces lie on the edges but are not corners.  
   - There are 12 edges on a cube.  
   - Each edge in a 4×4×4 has 4 cubes, of which 2 are corners, leaving 2 “middle” cubes per edge.  
   - So number with exactly two painted faces = 12 edges × 2 = 24.  
4. (For completeness: the 1-face cubes are the face-interiors: 6 faces × (4−2)² = 6×4 = 24; the 0-face cubes are the interior 2×2×2 block = 8; total checks out to 64.)

Thus there are 24 small cubes with exactly two painted faces.

Operation of mechanisms,"In a factory, there are three machines A, B, and C that are programmed to finish a task in exactly 1, 2, and 3 hours respectively. However, each machine needs a 30-minute setup time initially which doesn't count towards the task completion time. If all machines are started at the same time, how long will it take for all three machines to finish the task?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Each machine must spend 0.5 h (30 min) in setup before doing any actual work.  
2. After setup, machine A takes 1 h more, machine B takes 2 h more, and machine C takes 3 h more to finish its task.  
3. Thus their individual finish times (measured from the moment they’re all started) are:  
   - A: 0.5 h + 1 h = 1.5 h (1 h 30 min)  
   - B: 0.5 h + 2 h = 2.5 h (2 h 30 min)  
   - C: 0.5 h + 3 h = 3.5 h (3 h 30 min)  
4. “How long until all three machines have finished?” means we wait until the slowest one (C) is done. That is 3.5 h = 3 h 30 min.

Sequence solving,"In a unique sequence, each number is the sum of the 3 previous numbers. The sequence starts with 2, 2, and 4. What is the 6th number in the sequence?","Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The sequence is defined by a₁ = 2, a₂ = 2, a₃ = 4, and for n ≥ 4:  
   aₙ = aₙ₋₁ + aₙ₋₂ + aₙ₋₃.  
2. Compute the next terms:  
   a₄ = a₃ + a₂ + a₁ = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8  
   a₅ = a₄ + a₃ + a₂ = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14  
   a₆ = a₅ + a₄ + a₃ = 14 + 8 + 4 = 26  
3. The 6th term is 26, which corresponds to option 2.

Spatial reasoning,"In a cube-cutting challenge, you have a solid cube made of wood. In each move, you can make a straight cut through the cube. After the first cut, you now have two pieces. You make a second cut through both pieces, and now have four pieces. You make a third cut through all four pieces, and have some number of pieces now. Without rearranging any pieces between cuts, what is the maximum number of pieces you could have after the third cut?","1. Let P(n) be the maximum number of pieces after n planar cuts through the cube (with no rearrangement).  
2. After the first cut, P(1)=2 obvious.  
3. A new plane in space that intersects the cube and all previous planes in general position will cut through existing pieces and create as many new pieces as there are regions into which that plane is itself divided by its intersections with the earlier planes.  
4. When you add the k-th cut, it intersects the previous k – 1 planes in k – 1 lines.  In a plane, the maximum number of regions determined by m lines in general position is m(m+1)/2 + 1.  
5. Thus the k-th cut adds R(k–1)= (k–1)·k/2 + 1 new pieces, so  
   P(k) = P(k–1) + [ (k–1)·k/2 + 1 ].  
6. Check for k=2: new regions in the 2nd plane = 1·2/2 + 1=2, so P(2)=2+2=4.  
7. For the 3rd cut: R(2)=2·3/2 +1=3+1=4, so P(3)=P(2)+4=4+4=8.  
8. Therefore the maximum after three cuts is 8 pieces.

Logical traps,"In a special logic class, the teacher announces a surprise test will happen during the next week (Monday to Friday). However, the teacher also gives a hint: the test cannot be on Friday, since if it weren't given by Thursday, students would know for sure it was on Friday, and thus it would not be a surprise. After some thought, one clever student argues that following this logic, the test can't be on Thursday either, because come Wednesday night, without a test, Thursday would be the only remaining option, ceasing to be a surprise. Continuing this deduction, she concludes the test can't be on Wednesday... Tuesday... or even Monday! However, to the students' shock, the test was indeed given during the next week and it still was a surprise. How could this be, and when was the test given?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The student’s elimination argument hinges on backward induction:  
   - If by Thursday evening no test has occurred, Friday would be the only remaining day, so it couldn’t be a surprise on Friday.  
   - Ergo, Friday is ruled out.  
   - Then she reasons the same way for Thursday (if no test by Wednesday evening, Thursday would be “obvious”), then Wednesday, then Tuesday, then even Monday.

2. The flaw in that backward induction is that it assumes the students will be perfectly confident of those eliminations in advance. In reality, on Monday morning the students do not know whether the teacher’s “surprise” condition fails or not—Friday has only been “ruled out” by a hypothetical argument that trusts the earlier eliminations, so Monday is still a viable surprise day.

3. Thus nothing prevents the teacher from giving the test on Monday: when Monday arrives and no test has yet been given, the students have no firm basis to predict it—even on Monday morning it’s still a surprise.

4. Indeed, when the teacher gives the test on Monday, it satisfies the “surprise” condition. The student’s backward-elimination logic simply doesn’t apply to the first day.

Therefore the test was given on Monday, and the student’s all-day elimination was flawed.

Spatial reasoning,"Imagine you have a solid wooden cube that measures 3 units on each side. This cube is painted blue on all sides. After the paint dries, you slice this cube into 1-unit cubes. How many of the smaller 1-unit cubes will have exactly two sides painted blue?","1. Break down the 3×3×3 cube into its 27 unit cubes after painting all faces blue.  
2. Classify by number of painted faces:  
   - Corners (3 painted faces): 8 cubes  
   - Edge‐only (exactly 2 painted faces): each of the 12 edges has (3–2)=1 cube between its two corners, so 12 cubes  
   - Face centers (exactly 1 painted face): 6 faces ×1 center each = 6 cubes  
   - Interior (0 painted faces): 1 cube  
3. Thus, the number with exactly two painted faces = 12.

Optimization of actions and planning,"You are planning a small party and you have three types of beverages to choose from: juice, soda, and water. Based on your guests' preferences, you know the following: - 60% prefer juice, 20% prefer soda, and 20% prefer water. - You have a budget that allows you to buy a total of 100 drinks. - One unit of juice costs $1, soda costs $0.80, and water costs $0.50. - You want to satisfy the preferences of at least 90% of your guests. How many units of each beverage should you buy to meet the preferences and stay within the budget, assuming each guest will have one drink?","Here is the step-by-step check of each answer choice against the two hard constraints:  
  • Total drinks =100  
  • Satisfy ≥90 guests’ first choice  
(We also check cost ≤ the implied \$100 “juice‐equivalent” budget.)  

Let J,S,W = units of juice, soda, water bought.  
Preferences to satisfy: up to 60 juice‐lovers, 20 soda‐lovers, 20 water‐lovers.  
Number satisfied = min(J,60)+min(S,20)+min(W,20).  

Cost =1·J +0.8·S +0.5·W; budget ≤\$100.  

Check each option:  
1) 74J,13S,13W → sum=100; cost=74+10.4+6.5=90.9 OK; satisfied=60+13+13=86 (fails the ≥90 rule)  
2) 60J,20S,20W → sum=100; cost=60+16+10=86 OK; satisfied=60+20+20=100 ≥90 ✔  
3) 70J,15S,15W → sum=100; cost=70+12+7.5=89.5 OK; satisfied=60+15+15=90 ≥90 ✔  
4) 65J,17S,18W → sum=100; cost=65+13.6+9=87.6 OK; satisfied=60+17+18=95 ≥90 ✔  

Only choices 2, 3, and 4 meet the ≥90% preference rule.  Among these, the simplest “buy in direct proportion to stated preferences (60% juice, 20% soda, 20% water)” is choice 2, which also stays well under the budget.

Spatial reasoning,"A cube has edges of length 2 cm. If the largest possible cylinder is carved out of this cube, what will be the total surface area of the remaining part of the cube?","1. We have a cube of side 2 cm.  The “largest” right circular cylinder that fits in it in the obvious way has its axis perpendicular to one face, so  
   • radius r = ½·(side) = 1 cm  
   • height h = side = 2 cm  

2. Original surface‐area of cube = 6·(2×2) = 24 cm².  

3. When we drill the hole:  
   – We remove two circular disks (one on each of two opposite faces), total area removed = 2·πr² = 2π(1²) = 2π.  
   – We gain the cylindrical lateral surface, area = (circumference)·h = 2πr·h = 2π·1·2 = 4π.  

4. Total surface‐area of the remaining solid =  
   24 (original faces) – 2π (holes) + 4π (inner wall)  
   = 24 + 2π ≈ 24 + 6.283 = 30.283 cm²  

No option matches 30.283 cm², so it must be “another answer.”

Sequence solving,"Consider the sequence where each number indicates the position that the digit 2 appears for the first time in that number (for example, '10' is in position 1 because it contains the digit 2 for the first time as the sequence starts). What is the 5th number in this sequence?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We list the positive integers that contain the digit “2,” in increasing order:
   Term 1: 2  
   Term 2: 12  
   Term 3: 20  
   Term 4: 21  
   Term 5: 22

Spatial reasoning,"A sculptor is creating a unique set of sculptures by stacking cubes of the same size. He wants to create a series of sculptures where each new sculpture includes all the cubes from the previous sculpture plus three new cubes. The first sculpture is a single cube. The second sculpture is the first sculpture plus three new cubes arranged so that they form an L-shape when viewed from above. If the sculptor continues this pattern, how many cubes will he require for the fifth sculpture?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. 1st sculpture has 1 cube.  
2. Each subsequent sculpture adds 3 new cubes to the previous total.  
3. 2nd sculpture: 1 + 3 = 4 cubes.  
4. 3rd sculpture: 4 + 3 = 7 cubes.  
5. 4th sculpture: 7 + 3 = 10 cubes.  
6. 5th sculpture: 10 + 3 = 13 cubes.  

Therefore, the sculptor will require 13 cubes for the fifth sculpture.

Spatial reasoning,"Imagine a cube that is formed by 27 smaller identical cubes, making it a 3x3x3 cube. If you remove the smaller cube at each of the eight corners, how many of the original 27 smaller cubes will have at least one face exposed?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Label the small cubes by coordinates (x,y,z) with x,y,z each ∈{1,2,3}.  
2. The eight corner cubes are those with x,y,z all ∈{1,3}.  We remove those 8 cubes.  
3. That leaves 27−8=19 cubes in place.  Of these 19, only the very center cube (2,2,2) remains completely surrounded on all 6 sides—every other one now has at least one face exposed (either because it sits on an outer layer or it lost a neighboring corner cube).  
4. So among the 19 remaining cubes, 19−1=18 have ≥1 face exposed.  
5. In addition, the 8 corner cubes we removed each “came out” with all faces exposed, so they too count as having at least one face exposed.  
6. Therefore of the original 27 cubes, 18 (remaining exposed) + 8 (removed corners) = 26 cubes have at least one face exposed.

Sequence solving,"You are presented with a sequence of numbers: 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, ... What is the next number in the sequence?","1. List the given terms and compute consecutive differences  
   Term 1 (a₁) = 3  
   Term 2 (a₂) = 4 → Difference = 4 − 3 = 1  
   Term 3 (a₃) = 6 → Difference = 6 − 4 = 2  
   Term 4 (a₄) = 9 → Difference = 9 − 6 = 3  
   Term 5 (a₅) = 13 → Difference = 13 − 9 = 4  

2. Observe that the differences form the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, … which increases by 1 each time.

3. The next difference should be 5.  
   Thus the next term a₆ = a₅ + 5 = 13 + 5 = 18.

Optimization of actions and planning,"You are the operations manager at a factory producing widgets. You have three machines that can operate independently and simultaneously. Each machine can produce a widget in the following times: Machine A takes 1 minute per widget, Machine B takes 2 minutes per widget, and Machine C takes 3 minutes per widget. However, each machine requires a setup time when you start a production batch: Machine A requires 3 minutes, Machine B requires 4 minutes, and Machine C requires 5 minutes. Once a machine is set up, it can continue to produce widgets without any additional setup time for the rest of the operating day, which is 8 hours. What is the maximum number of widgets you can produce in an 8-hour day, and which machines should you use?","Step‐by‐step reasoning:

1. Total available time per machine = 8 hours = 480 minutes.  
2. For each machine, you must spend its one‐time setup, then use the remaining minutes to produce widgets at its per-widget rate:  
   - Machine A: setup = 3 min ⇒ production time = 480–3 = 477 min. At 1 min/widget ⇒ 477 widgets.  
   - Machine B: setup = 4 min ⇒ production time = 480–4 = 476 min. At 2 min/widget ⇒ ⌊476/2⌋ = 238 widgets.  
   - Machine C: setup = 5 min ⇒ production time = 480–5 = 475 min. At 3 min/widget ⇒ ⌊475/3⌋ = 158 widgets.  
3. Since machines run independently and simultaneously, you should use all three machines.  
4. Total = 477 + 238 + 158 = 873 widgets in 480 minutes.  
5. No listed option matches 873, so it must be “Another answer.”

Spatial reasoning,"In a mystical land, there are three temples, each on top of a hill. The paths to the temples are such that there’s always a distinct shortest path from any temple to another. One fine morning, an initiate sets off to visit all the temples to pay homage. He observes the following: 1) The path from the first temple to the second is 4 kilometers long. 2) The path from the second temple to the third is 3 kilometers long. 3) The uphill path from the first to the third temple is 5 kilometers long. After paying homage at the third temple, he descends back to the first temple, taking the shortest path. How long is his entire journey?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We are given three temples T₁, T₂, T₃ and the pairwise distances along the unique shortest paths:
   - d(T₁,T₂) = 4 km  
   - d(T₂,T₃) = 3 km  
   - d(T₁,T₃) (direct uphill) = 5 km  
2. The initiate’s route is T₁ → T₂ → T₃ → T₁ (returning by the shortest path from T₃ back to T₁).
3. Check possible routes from T₃ back to T₁:
   - Direct path T₃→T₁ has length 5 km.
   - Indirect path T₃→T₂→T₁ has length 3 + 4 = 7 km.
   Since the direct path (5 km) is shorter, he takes that.
4. Total distance traveled = 4 km (T₁→T₂) + 3 km (T₂→T₃) + 5 km (T₃→T₁) = 12 km.

Logical traps,"Alice, Bob, and Carol are discussing two different numbers. Alice says 'The number I am thinking of is greater than 4.' Bob says 'The number I am thinking of is not the highest.' Carol says 'The number I am thinking of is not the lowest.' All three are thinking of different numbers between 1 and 6, inclusive. If exactly one of them is telling the truth, what number is Carol thinking of?","Let A, B, C be the three numbers Alice, Bob, Carol think of.  We are told

  (i)   A, B, C are all distinct and lie in {1,2,3,4,5,6}.  
  (ii)  Alice’s statement “A>4” is either true or false.  
  (iii) Bob’s statement “B is not the highest of the three” is either true or false.  
  (iv)  Carol’s statement “C is not the lowest of the three” is either true or false.  
  (v)   Exactly one of those three statements is true.

We must find all triples (A,B,C) satisfying (i–v), and then see what values C can take.  If that set of possible C–values does not pin down a unique one among {3,4,5,6}, we must choose “Another answer.”

1)  Case “Alice’s statement is the only true one”  
    – A>4 must hold, while Bob’s and Carol’s must both fail.  
    – Bob’s fails ⇒ B is the highest ⇒ B>max(A,C).  
    – Carol’s fails ⇒ C is the lowest ⇒ C<min(A,B).  
    – Hence C<A<B, with A>4, distinct.  The only way is A=5, B=6, C any of {1,2,3,4}.  
    ⇒ In this case C∈{1,2,3,4}.

2)  Case “Bob’s statement is the only true one”  
    – B not highest must hold, while Alice’s (A>4) fails ⇒ A≤4, and Carol’s fails ⇒ C is the lowest.  
    – So C<min(A,B) and B<max(A,B,C)=A ⇒ B<A, with A≤4.  
    – Checking small A gives exactly 4 solutions:  
         (A,B,C) = (3,2,1), (4,3,1), (4,3,2), (4,2,1).  
    ⇒ C∈{1,2} here.

3)  Case “Carol’s statement is the only true one”  
    – C not lowest holds, while Alice’s fails (A≤4) and Bob’s fails (B is highest).  
    – So B>max(A,C) and C>min(A,B) ⇒ A< … < B with A≤4.  One finds many solutions with C∈{2,3,4,5}.

In none of the three mutually exclusive “exactly‐one‐true” cases is C pinned down to a single value in {3,4,5,6}.  Across all valid scenarios C can be 1,2,3,4 or 5, so there is no unique choice among 3,4,5,6.  

Therefore the correct answer is “Another answer.”

Classic riddles,"Two fathers and two sons went fishing. Each of them caught one fish, so they brought home three fishes in total. How is that possible?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The riddle says “two fathers and two sons went fishing” and “each of them caught one fish,” yet they brought home only three fish total.  
2. If you try to assume four distinct people (two fathers + two sons), you’d expect four fish, not three.  
3. To reconcile “two fathers and two sons” with only three people, one person must serve as both a father and a son simultaneously.  
4. A three‐generation grouping achieves this:  
   - Grandfather (a father, but not a son in this group)  
   - His son (who is both a son to the grandfather and a father to the grandson)  
   - His grandson (a son, but not a father)  
5. In this trio there are indeed two fathers (grandfather and father) and two sons (father and grandson), yet only three individuals—hence three fish.

Optimization of actions and planning,"In an online strategy game, you're tasked with building a new base. You start with 100 resources. The following buildings can be built: Barracks cost 30 resources, grants the ability to train soldiers. Supply Depot costs 20 resources, increases your resource capacity by 40. Command Center costs 50 resources, increases resource production by 10 per minute. You also passively gain 10 resources per minute. You cannot exceed your resource capacity, which starts at 100. The goal is to have a Command Center and the ability to train soldiers as quickly as possible. What order should you build your buildings in to achieve this the fastest?","Here’s the detailed reasoning:

1. We start with 100 resources, 100‐point capacity, and +10 r/min passive income.  
2. The only two buildings required to “finish” are:  
   – Barracks (30 r), to be able to train soldiers  
   – Command Center (50 r), to meet the second goal  
3. A Supply Depot (20 r) only raises capacity; since our capacity is already 100 and we need at most 80 to pay for Barracks+Command Center, we never hit the cap. Thus it is never on the critical path to having both required buildings up.  
4. We therefore should spend 80 r immediately on the two required buildings. Any order of those two is effectively instantaneous (assuming no build time). The Supply Depot, if ever built, can be done later without affecting when we achieve “Barracks+Command Center.”  
5. None of the provided sequences that force you to build a Supply Depot before finishing are strictly optimal; the truly fastest “order” is simply “build Barracks and Command Center immediately, skip (or defer) the Supply Depot entirely.”

Because no offered choice (1–4) omits the Supply Depot in the critical path, the correct answer is:

Spatial reasoning,"You are in a room with no windows and only one door. The room is filled with mirrors on all walls. In the middle of the room stands a statue. You have a laser pointer that can bounce off the mirrors. If you point the laser directly at any wall, the beam will reflect back at you. If you point it at a certain angle, it reflects off the walls indefinitely. Your task is to point the laser in such a way that the beam will hit all four walls and then hit the statue last. How do you position the laser beam?","Here’s how to see it step by step:

1.  Model the mirrored room by “unfolding” it into a grid of reflected copies of the room.  In that picture your laser travels in a straight line across successive copies.  
2.  To make the beam strike all four real walls once before returning to the center statue, your slope (rise/run) must correspond to visiting each of the four sides in turn.  The simplest choice of slope that does this (in lowest‐term rational form with numerator and denominator both odd) is 1 (i.e. a 45° diagonal).  
3.  From your real‐room position, a 45° shot aimed directly into a corner makes the beam in the unfolded picture pass through the centers of four distinct rooms (i.e. hit each of the four walls exactly once) before finally closing back on the central point.  In the actual room this means it bounces off W, N, E, S (in some order) and then returns to strike the statue last.  

None of the other options guarantees visits to all four walls before hitting the statue.

Optimization of actions and planning,"Alice has to prepare 3 different types of cookies for an event. The chocolate chip cookies take 15 minutes to prepare and 10 minutes to bake. The sugar cookies take 10 minutes to prepare and 15 minutes to bake. The oatmeal raisin cookies take 12 minutes to prepare and 12 minutes to bake. She has only one oven, which can bake one type of cookies at a time. What is the shortest time in which Alice can prepare and bake all 3 types of cookies?","Here is the detailed reasoning:

1. Model this as a two‐machine flow‐shop scheduling problem  
   – Machine 1 (“prep”) times aᵢ:  
     • Chocolate chip: a₁ = 15  
     • Sugar:           a₂ = 10  
     • Oatmeal raisin:  a₃ = 12  
   – Machine 2 (“bake”) times bᵢ:  
     • Chocolate chip: b₁ = 10  
     • Sugar:           b₂ = 15  
     • Oatmeal raisin:  b₃ = 12  

2. Apply Johnson’s rule:  
   – Partition jobs into  
     S₁ = {i | aᵢ ≤ bᵢ} and S₂ = {i | aᵢ > bᵢ}  
     • Chocolate chip: 15 > 10 ⇒ S₂  
     • Sugar:          10 ≤ 15 ⇒ S₁  
     • Oatmeal:        12 ≤ 12 ⇒ S₁  
   – Sequence S₁ in ascending order of aᵢ, then S₂ in descending order of bᵢ  
     • S₁ sorted by prep time → Sugar (10), then Oatmeal (12)  
     • S₂ sorted by bake time → Chocolate chip (only one)  
   ⇒ Optimal sequence: Sugar → Oatmeal → Chocolate chip  

3. Compute schedule lengths  
   Let C1[j] = completion on prep, C2[j] = completion on bake  
   – Sugar:  
     C1 = 0 + 10 = 10  
     C2 = max(0,10) + 15 = 25  
   – Oatmeal:  
     C1 = 10 + 12 = 22  
     C2 = max(25,22) + 12 = 37  
   – Chocolate chip:  
     C1 = 22 + 15 = 37  
     C2 = max(37,37) + 10 = 47  

Makespan = 47 minutes.

Since 47 is not among options 1–4, the answer is “another answer.”

Operation of mechanisms,"Four friends are exploring an ancient temple with a complicated door mechanism. The door has four levers, and each lever can be in one of three positions: up, middle, or down. To open the door, the levers have to be in a specific configuration. They found a clue that reads: 'The first lever stands alone in its position. The second and third levers are not in the middle together. The fourth lever is in the opposite position of the second lever. One lever is up, one is in the middle, one is down, and one is lying about its position.' Which lever is lying based on its position in the clue, and what is the correct configuration to open the door?","Here’s the cleanest way to see it:

 S2 (by Lever 2): “Levers 2 and 3 are not both in the middle.”  
 S3 (by Lever 3): “Lever 4 is in the position opposite Lever 2 (i.e. Up↔Down).”  
 S4 (by Lever 4): “Among us four, one is Up, one is Middle, one is Down, and exactly one lever is lying.”  

We require exactly one statement false.  Now check each offered configuration:

Option 2:  
 L1=Middle, L2=Down, L3=Up, L4=Up  
– S1 true (L1=Mid and no one else is Mid).  
– S2 true (L2=Down, L3=Up, so certainly not both Middle).  
– S3 true (L2=Down ⇒ L4 should be Up).  
– S4 false (we actually have two Ups, one Mid, one Down ⇒ the “one Up, one Mid, one Down” part fails).  

Thus exactly S4 is false ⇒ exactly one lever (lever 4) is lying. No other option yields exactly one false statement.

Sequence solving,"You are given a sequence of numbers: 2, 6, 18, 54. What would be the next number in the sequence if the pattern continues?","1. Observe the given sequence: 2, 6, 18, 54.  
2. Compute ratios between successive terms:  
   • 6 ÷ 2 = 3  
   • 18 ÷ 6 = 3  
   • 54 ÷ 18 = 3  
3. The pattern is “multiply the previous term by 3.”

Spatial reasoning,"There is a cube with edges of length 4 units. It is fully painted on all sides and then divided into smaller cubes of 1 unit edge each. Without any of the cubes being removed, a single straight cut is made through the cube. What is the maximum number of smaller cubes that can have paint on exactly one side now visble as a result of this cut?","My interpretation is that the only way to get full unit‐squares of original paint showing on the newly‐cut face is to slice along planes that coincide with the little–cube faces, and the best you can do is to cut parallel to one of the big‐cube’s faces, one layer in.  That cuts right through the “second” layer of small cubes, exposing exactly one painted face on each of those 4×4=16 cubes—and no tilted cut can expose more full painted unit‐squares.  

Hence the maximum number of 1×1 painted faces revealed on that single straight cut is 16, coming from 16 small cubes each showing exactly one painted side.

Spatial reasoning,"You are in a room with 4 doors, each facing the cardinal directions: North, East, South, and West. Each door leads to a room that looks identical to the first, with its own 4 doors also facing the cardinal directions. You start by facing North and walk into the North door. In the second room, you face East and walk through the East door. In the third room, you face South and walk through the South door. Finally, in the fourth room, you turn to face West and walk through the West door. In which direction are you facing now in the fifth room?","Step‐by‐step reasoning:

1. In Room 1 you start facing North. You walk straight through the North door → you enter Room 2 still facing North.  
2. In Room 2 you turn to face East, then go through the East door → you enter Room 3 facing East.  
3. In Room 3 you turn to face South, then go through the South door → you enter Room 4 facing South.  
4. In Room 4 you turn to face West, then go through the West door → you enter Room 5 facing West.  

You are not instructed to turn again in Room 5, so you remain facing West.

Lateral thinking,A man is found dead in a field holding a piece of straw. There's nothing else around him except for the straw and the clothes he has on. How did he die?,"Step-by-step reasoning  
1. We’re told the only object with the dead man is a single piece of straw and his clothes—nothing else (no weapon, no disease clues, no bullet holes mentioned).  
2. “Piece of straw” suggests the children’s game of drawing straws to make a random choice.  
3. If he’d drawn the short straw among others, he’d be the one forced to do something dangerous.  
4. A classic lateral‐thinking scenario: a group in a hot-air balloon, too heavy to stay aloft, draw straws; the one with the short straw must jump out to save the rest.  
5. He drew the short straw, jumped from the balloon over that very field, and died on impact—still clutching the useless straw that sealed his fate.

Operation of mechanisms,"In a factory, there are three machines A, B, and C that are used to create widgets. Machine A creates a widget every 3 minutes, Machine B every 7 minutes, and Machine C every 11 minutes. If all machines are turned on at the same time, how many minutes will pass before all three machines dispense a widget at the same minute for the first time?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We want the first time \(T>0\) such that
   \[
     T \equiv 0 \pmod{3},\quad
     T \equiv 0 \pmod{7},\quad
     T \equiv 0 \pmod{11}.
   \]
2. Since 3, 7, and 11 are pairwise coprime, their least common multiple is
   \[
     \mathrm{lcm}(3,7,11) = 3 \times 7 \times 11 = 231.

Operation of mechanisms,"You are an engineer tasked with designing a gear system consisting of three gears that will fit in a sequential lineup within a machine. Each gear is required to have a unique number of teeth and must mesh with its neighboring gear(s). Gear A has 28 teeth and must connect with Gear B. Gear B must connect with both Gear A and Gear C. If the total number of teeth across all three gears shouldn't exceed 100 and the gears must have an integer number of teeth, what is the number of teeth on Gear B and Gear C?","Here’s the step‐by‐step reasoning:

1. Gear A has 28 teeth. Let Gear B have B teeth, Gear C have C teeth.  
2. Total‐teeth constraint: 28 + B + C ≤ 100 ⇒ B + C ≤ 72.  
3. All gears must have different (integer) tooth counts.  
4. For smooth, even wear each meshing pair should have no common tooth factors ⇒ gcd(28,B)=1 and gcd(B,C)=1.  
5. Check each answer choice (all of them have B+C=72, so the total hits exactly 100):  
   1) B=29, C=43  
      • gcd(28, 29)=1 (29 is prime, not a divisor of 28)  
      • gcd(29, 43)=1 (both primes, distinct)  
      ✓ Unique counts, meet all criteria.  
   2) B=30, C=42  
      • gcd(28, 30)=2 ≠1 ⇒ fails.

Optimization of actions and planning,"You have 12 boxes that look identical and contain identical items, but one box is filled with defective items weighing slightly less than the others. Your task is to determine which box contains the defective items. You have at your disposal a balance scale, which allows you to compare the weight of two sets of boxes against each other. You can only use the scale three times. How would you identify the box with defective items?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Goal: find the one lighter box out of 12 using only three balance‐scale weighings. Because we know the odd box is lighter, each weighing gives three possible outcomes (left pan lighter, right pan lighter, or balance), so in three weighings we can distinguish up to 3³ = 27 cases > 12 boxes.

2. First weighing: divide the 12 boxes into three groups of four (call them A, B, C). Weigh A versus B.
   - If A = B, the light box is in C.
   - If A < B, the light box is in A.
   - If A > B, the light box is in B.

   In one weighing we narrow from 12 boxes down to 4.

3. Second weighing: take the 4 suspect boxes (say group X of size 4). Split X into two groups of two: X1 and X2. Weigh X1 versus X2.
   - If X1 = X2, the light box is in the remaining two unweighed boxes.
   - If X1 < X2, it’s in X1.
   - If X1 > X2, it’s in X2.

   Now we have at most 2 candidate boxes.

4. Third weighing: weigh one of those two candidates against the other (or against a known good box). The lighter one is the defective box.

This is exactly “split into three groups, use one weighing to pick the group of four, then subdivide,” i.e. option 3.

Lateral thinking,"Alice, Bob, and Charlie are trapped on an island with a bridge that can only hold two people at a time. They have one flashlight and, because it's nighttime, the flashlight must be used when crossing the bridge. Alice can cross the bridge in 1 minute, Bob in 2 minutes, and Charlie in 5 minutes. When two people cross together, they must move at the slower person's pace. What is the shortest time in which all three can get across the bridge?","Step‐by‐step reasoning:

1. List individual crossing times:
   - Alice (A): 1 minute  
   - Bob   (B): 2 minutes  
   - Charlie (C): 5 minutes  

2. At most two can cross at once, and they need the flashlight. When two cross, they go at the slower person’s pace.

3. We want to minimize total time. A key insight in these puzzles is to have the fastest person do most of the “returning” with the flashlight.

4. Consider the following sequence:
   a. A and B cross to the far side: takes 2 minutes (they go at B’s speed).  
   b. A returns with the flashlight: takes 1 minute.  
   c. A and C cross to the far side: takes 5 minutes (they go at C’s speed).  

   After step (a): far side has A, B; start side has C  
   After step (b): far side has B; start side has A, C  
   After step (c): far side has A, B, C; start side is empty  

5. Total time = 2 + 1 + 5 = 8 minutes.

No other sequence can beat 8 minutes without leaving someone stranded or adding extra return trips.

Operation of mechanisms,"Alice, Bob, and Charlie are three engineers designing a cog-based mechanism for a clock. The mechanism includes three cogs that have to engage with each other without slipping. Cog A has 36 teeth, Cog B has 48 teeth, and Cog C has 60 teeth. If they design the mechanism for Cog A to make 10 full rotations, how many complete rotations will Cog C make in the same time, assuming there is no slippage and they rotate at a constant rate?","1. Step-by-step reasoning  
   a. When two gears mesh without slipping, their angular velocities are inversely proportional to their tooth counts.  
   b. Cog A (36 teeth) drives Cog B (48 teeth).  
      – Ratio of rotations: ω_B = ω_A × (N_A / N_B) = ω_A × (36 / 48) = ω_A × (3/4).  
   c. Cog B (48 teeth) then drives Cog C (60 teeth).  
      – Ratio of rotations: ω_C = ω_B × (N_B / N_C) = ω_B × (48 / 60) = ω_B × (4/5).  
   d. Combine the two stages:  
      ω_C = ω_A × (3/4) × (4/5) = ω_A × (3/5).  
   e. If Cog A makes 10 full rotations, Cog C makes  
      10 × (3/5) = 6 full rotations.

2. “I have space but no room.”  
   - A keyboard has a Space bar (space) but no rooms.  
3. “You can enter, but you can’t go outside.”

Optimization of actions and planning,"Alice, Bob, and Charlie are three friends who decide to paint a room together. They find that Alice can paint the room completely by herself in 5 hours, Bob can do it in 6 hours, and Charlie in 8 hours. They start painting together at the same pace they normally would by themselves, but after 2 hours, Charlie has to leave. How much time, in hours, will it take for Alice and Bob to finish painting the room after Charlie leaves?","1. Compute individual rates (rooms per hour):  
   Alice: 1/5  
   Bob:   1/6  
   Charlie: 1/8  

2. Their combined rate for the first 2 hours is  
   1/5 + 1/6 + 1/8 = (24 + 20 + 15)/120 = 59/120 room per hour.  

3. In 2 hours they paint  
   (59/120)×2 = 59/60 of the room.  

4. Remaining work = 1 − 59/60 = 1/60 of the room.  

5. After Charlie leaves, Alice + Bob rate = 1/5 + 1/6 = (6 + 5)/30 = 11/30 room per hour.  

6. Time to finish the remaining 1/60 room = (1/60) ÷ (11/30) = (1/60)×(30/11) = 1/22 hour ≈ 0.04545 hour ≈ 2.73 minutes.  

That is not among options 1–4.

Optimization of actions and planning,"In a tiny village, the baker, the butcher, and the candlestick maker are the only three shops that deliver their goods. They use a shared delivery boy who can carry only one type of goods per trip. Every morning, each shop sends out one type of good: bread, meat, or candles. The delivery boy is paid per trip, so he wants to minimize the number of trips while still delivering every good once. Unfortunately, the baker and the butcher's goods spoil after 3 trips, while the candles are fine no matter how many trips are made. Given that he delivers goods in the pattern B-B-C-M (Baker, Butcher, Candlestick maker, then Meat from the Butcher again), how should he plan his delivery route to minimize his trips and not spoil any goods?","Step‐by‐step reasoning:

1.  What must be delivered?  In the order the houses lie on the road (or in the “pattern”), there are two bread stops (B, B), then one candle stop (C), then one meat stop (M).  
2.  Trip constraints:  
    – He can load only one type of good per outing.  
    – Bread and meat go bad if they sit more than three of his round‐trips undelivered; candles never spoil.  
    – He’s paid per trip, so wants as few trips as possible.  
3.  Can he combine the two breads?  Yes.  On trip 1 he loads bread once, goes past the first B‐house, drops one loaf, continues to the second B‐house, drops the second loaf, then returns.  That takes care of both B stops in a single trip.  (No spoilage, since bread is delivered immediately on that same trip.)  
4.  Next he must serve the single candle customer.  On trip 2 he loads candles, goes to the C‐house, delivers, and returns.  (Candles won’t spoil, so timing doesn’t matter.)  
5.  Finally the meat customer.  On trip 3 he loads meat, goes out to the M‐house, delivers, and returns.  Because meat only needed for one stop here, he delivers immediately, so there’s no spoilage.  
6.  That covers B–B–C–M in only three trips, which is clearly minimal (you can’t mix types in one trip, so you need at least one trip for each type).  

Answer choice 4, “B–C–M,” is exactly that three‐trip plan.

Sequence solving,"Consider the following sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, _. What number should replace the underscore to continue the sequence correctly?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. List the given terms: 2, 6, 12, 20, _  
2. Compute successive differences:  
   6 – 2 = 4  
   12 – 6 = 6  
   20 – 12 = 8  
3. Observe that the differences increase by 2 each time (4, 6, 8, …), so the next difference should be 10.  
4. Add this next difference to the last known term:  
   20 + 10 = 30  
5. Recognize this is also the sequence of “pronic” numbers n·(n+1):  
   1·2 = 2, 2·3 = 6, 3·4 = 12, 4·5 = 20, 5·6 = 30

Operation of mechanisms,"You are presented with three machines. Each machine has two input slots and one output slot. The first machine multiplies any two numbers put into its input slots. The second machine adds together any two numbers put into its input slots. The third machine applies a modulus operation of the first input number by the second input number. You have an initial set of cards with numbers [3, 7, 11], and you can use each card only once in any of the machines. Your task is to find a sequence of operations using the machines that will result in an output of 2.","Here’s the reasoning through each proposed sequence:

Option 1:  
– Multiply 3 × 7 = 21  (uses cards 3 and 7)  
– Add 11: 21 + 11 = 32  (uses card 11)  
– Modulus by 3: 32 mod 3 = 2  (would need to reuse card 3)  
Invalid because it reuses the “3”‐card a second time.

Option 2:  
– Add 3 + 7 = 10  (uses 3,7)  
– Modulus by 11: 10 mod 11 = 10  (uses 11)  
– Multiply by 3: 10 × 3 = 30  (reuses 3)  
Fails to yield 2 (and reuses 3).

Option 3:  
– Add 3 + 7 = 10  (uses 3,7)  
– Modulus 11 by 10: 11 mod 10 = 1  (uses 11)  
– Multiply by 3: 1 × 3 = 3  
– Modulus by 7: 3 mod 7 = 3  
Yields 3 (and would reuse cards).

Option 4:  
– Multiply 11 × 7 = 77  (uses 11,7)  
– Add 3: 77 + 3 = 80  (uses 3)  
– Modulus by 11: 80 mod 11 = 3  (reuses 11)  
Yields 3, not 2 (and reuses 11).

None of (1)–(4) both respects the “each card only once” rule and gives 2.  

A perfectly valid way (using just one machine) is simply:

Operation of mechanisms,"In a factory, there are three conveyor belts with sensors at their start and end points. Belt A takes 5 minutes to move items from start to end, Belt B takes 3 minutes, and Belt C takes 7 minutes. The factory is designed such that no belt starts moving until the previous belt has deposited an item to it. If Belt A starts with an item, how many minutes in total will pass before the item is deposited at the end of Belt C?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Belt A starts with the item at time t=0.  
2. Belt A takes 5 minutes to carry the item to its end. At t=5 min the item arrives at Belt B’s start.  
3. Belt B does not start until the item arrives at t=5 min. Belt B then takes 3 minutes to move it to its end. So at t=5+3=8 min the item arrives at Belt C’s start.  
4. Belt C waits until t=8 min, then takes 7 minutes to carry the item to its end. Thus the item is finally deposited at t=8+7=15 min.

Optimization of actions and planning,"You have 12 hours to prepare an important report. The report will take 10 hours to write. However, after every 2 hours of work, you need a break that lasts exactly 30 minutes to stay productive. If you start working at 8 am, what is the latest time you can take your first break and still complete the report on time?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. You have 12 hours total (8 am–8 pm) to get 10 hours of writing done.
2. A break is required after every 2 hours of continuous work, and each break is exactly 30 minutes.
3. To accumulate 10 hours of work, you need five 2-hour work blocks. Breaks are only required between those blocks, not after the last one—so you take four 30-minute breaks in total.
4. Total time = 10 hours writing + 4 × 0.5 hour breaks = 10 + 2 = 12 hours. That exactly fills the 8 am–8 pm window.
5. Hence the first break must come immediately after the first 2-hour block, i.e. 8 am + 2 hours = 10:00 am.

Operation of mechanisms,"Jake is trying to fix an old clock. The clock is designed with three gears that interlock. Gear A has 8 teeth and rotates clockwise. Gear B has 10 teeth and interlocks with Gear A, which means it rotates counter-clockwise. Gear C has 6 teeth and interlocks with Gear B. If Jake starts turning Gear A, after how many full rotations of Gear A will all gears return to their original starting positions?","1. Let n be the number of full rotations of Gear A.  
2. Gear A (8 teeth) driving Gear B (10 teeth): every 1 rotation of A makes B rotate \(-\tfrac{8}{10}=-\tfrac{4}{5}\) rotations (negative sign = opposite direction).  
   After n rotations of A, B has done \(-\tfrac{4}{5}n\) rotations. For B to return to its original orientation, \(-\tfrac{4}{5}n\) must be an integer ⇒ 4n must be divisible by 5 ⇒ n is a multiple of 5.  
3. Gear B driving Gear C (6 teeth): every 1 rotation of B makes C rotate \(-\tfrac{10}{6}=-\tfrac{5}{3}\) rotations. So after n rotations of A, C has done  
   \(-\tfrac{4}{5}n)·(-\tfrac{5}{3}) = +\tfrac{4}{3}n\) rotations. For C to return to its original orientation, \(\tfrac{4}{3}n\) must be an integer ⇒ 4n divisible by 3 ⇒ n is a multiple of 3.

Spatial reasoning,You have been given a challenge to fit a number of 1x1x1 cubes into a larger cube container without any overlap or empty space. The larger cube container has a side length of 4 units. What is the minimum number of 1x1x1 cubes needed to fit entirely within the larger cube without any empty space remaining?,"Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. The larger cube has side length 4 units.  
2. Its volume is 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 cubic units.  
3. Each small cube is 1 × 1 × 1, so its volume is 1 cubic unit.  
4. To fill the larger cube completely (with no empty space and no overlap), the total volume of the small cubes must equal 64 cubic units.  
5. Since each small cube is 1 cubic unit, you need 64 of them to reach a total volume of 64.

Therefore, the minimum number of 1×1×1 cubes needed is 64, which corresponds to option 1.

Optimization of actions and planning,"You are a librarian tasked with organizing a set of 5 books on a single shelf. Every day you need to pull one book from the shelf to reference, but the order they are pulled is unknown. You can arrange the books however you like initially. To save time in the long run, you devise a system where after using a book, you place it back on the far right side of the shelf. Given that the books have equal probability of being chosen each day, which arrangement would minimize the average time spent searching for the books over a period of 100 days?","Here’s the reasoning in steps:

1. Model  
   - We have 5 books in a list.  
   - Each day, one of the 5 is chosen uniformly at random.  
   - After use, the chosen book is moved to the far right end (position 5), and the others shift left as needed.  

2. Long‐run (stationary) behavior  
   - Because each book has equal probability 1/5 of being requested, there is complete symmetry among the books.  
   - Under the “move‐to‐back” rule, no book has a systematically higher chance of occupying an earlier or later position in the long run.  
   - The process is irreducible and aperiodic on the finite state space of all orderings, so it converges to a unique stationary distribution.  

3. Stationary distribution  
   - By symmetry, in the steady state every permutation of the 5 books is equally likely.  
   - Thus the expected position of the requested book on any given day is the average of {1,2,3,4,5}, namely (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3.  

4. Independence from initial arrangement  
   - After a “mixing” period (on the order of a few dozen days for n=5), the arrangement ‘forgets’ the start.  
   - Over a 100‐day horizon, essentially the same average search time is achieved regardless of how you begin the ordering.  

5. Conclusion  
   - No particular fixed initial order (alphabetical, size‐order, etc.) confers any long‐run advantage.  
   - Therefore the best you can say is that the choice of initial arrangement doesn’t matter.

3. The most balanced split is 8 tasks on one, 7 on the other:  
   – Assistant A: n₁ = 8 ⇒ time = 10·8 − 3 = 77  
   – Assistant B: n₂ = 7 ⇒ time = 10·7 − 3 = 67  
   ⇒ makespan = max(77, 67) = 77 minutes.  
4. Any more uneven split (9+6, etc.) gives a larger maximum.  

Hence the minimum time is 77 minutes, which is Answer Option 2.

Sequence solving,"You discover an ancient tablet with a sequence of symbols that appear to have a logical progression: @, #, %, ^, &, ?. Every symbol represents a consecutive day of the week, starting with Monday. Based on the pattern, which symbol would correspond to Sunday?","1. Step-by-step reasoning:

- The tablet’s symbols are given in order: @, #, %, ^, &, ?.  
- We’re told these correspond to consecutive days of the week starting with Monday.  
  - Monday   → @  
  - Tuesday  → #  
  - Wednesday→ %  
  - Thursday → ^  
  - Friday   → &  
  - Saturday → ?  

- After Saturday comes Sunday.  Since the sequence has only six symbols, the seventh day loops back to the start of the pattern.  
- Therefore, Sunday corresponds to the first symbol, “@.”

2. The correct answer is option 1.

Optimization of actions and planning,"A sales representative has four cities to visit: A, B, C, and D. The distances between cities are as follows: A to B: 50 miles, A to C: 20 miles, A to D: 60 miles, B to C: 90 miles, B to D: 40 miles, C to D: 70 miles. She must visit each city once and return to the original departure city. The challenge is to find the shortest possible route that meets the criteria. What is the total distance of the shortest route?","1. Reasoning:

- This is a symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) on four cities A, B, C, D with the given pairwise distances.

- Because the route is a cycle and distances are symmetric, we can fix the starting city at A and list all permutations of visiting the other three cities. There are 3! = 6 such routes:

  1. A → B → C → D → A  
     Distance = AB + BC + CD + DA  
              = 50 + 90 + 70 + 60  
              = 270

  2. A → B → D → C → A  
     Distance = AB + BD + DC + CA  
              = 50 + 40 + 70 + 20  
              = 180

  3. A → C → B → D → A  
     Distance = AC + CB + BD + DA  
              = 20 + 90 + 40 + 60  
              = 210

  4. A → C → D → B → A  
     Distance = AC + CD + DB + BA  
              = 20 + 70 + 40 + 50  
              = 180

  5. A → D → B → C → A  
     Distance = AD + DB + BC + CA  
              = 60 + 40 + 90 + 20  
              = 210

  6. A → D → C → B → A  
     Distance = AD + DC + CB + BA  
              = 60 + 70 + 90 + 50  
              = 270

- The shortest total distance found is 180 miles (routes 2 and 4).

- Since 180 miles is not among options 1–4, the correct choice is “Another answer.”

Sequence solving,"You discover an ancient book with a series of numbers on a page: 2, 12, 36, 80, 150, __. Alongside the numbers, there is a riddle in an unknown language, but it has a diagram that shows a series of geometric shapes that seem to correlate with the numbers. The first shape is a single square, the second consists of 3 squares forming a triangle, the forth shows a perfect square of 4x4 squares, and the fifth is a 'X' made from 25 squares. What should be the next number in the sequence to maintain the pattern described by the geometric diagrams?","1. Let the terms be a₁=2, a₂=12, a₃=36, a₄=80, a₅=150.  
2. Compute first differences:  
   d₂=a₂–a₁=10,  
   d₃=24,  
   d₄=44,  
   d₅=70.  
3. Compute second differences:  
   Δ₂₂=d₃–d₂=14,  
   Δ₃₂=20,  
   Δ₄₂=26.  
4. These second differences increase by a constant 6 (20–14=6, 26–20=6), so the third differences are constant. Hence the sequence is generated by a cubic (or by the known formula aₙ = n²·(n+1)).  
5. For a₆, the next first‐difference d₆ = d₅ + (next second‐difference) = 70 + (26+6) = 70 + 32 = 102.  
6. Therefore a₆ = a₅ + d₆ = 150 + 102 = 252.  

252 does not appear in options 1–4, so it must be “another answer.”

Spatial reasoning,"You have a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube which is scrambled. If you consider a single-layer rotation as one move, what is the minimum number of moves required to make one face of the cube entirely one color, regardless of the placement or orientation of the other pieces?","Below is an outline of how one arrives at “7” as the face‐God’s‐number in the face‐turn metric for solving just one face of a 3×3×3 cube.

1.  Definitions and setup  
    •  We count each single‐layer 90° or 180° turn as one move (face‐turn metric with half‐turn = 1).  
    •  We scramble the cube arbitrarily, then choose whichever color/face we like to be the one we will make solid.  We ask: in the worst scramble, how many moves do we absolutely need to guarantee that we can collect all nine stickers of our chosen color onto its face (ignoring the arrangement of the other five faces)?  

2.  Lower‐bound intuition  
    •  Every face has 1 fixed center sticker of its color; that leaves 8 cubie‐stickers (4 edges, 4 corners) to bring into place.  
    •  A single quarter‐turn of an adjacent face (say F, R, B, or L, leaving U as our target) can bring at most one edge‐sticker + one corner‐sticker of our color up onto the U face.  Thus in the best case each such move adds 2 new stickers to U.  
    •  Since we need to add 8 stickers, we need at least ⌈8/2⌉ = 4 moves.  Hence 4 is a hard lower bound—but that’s only in the perfect alignment case (every needed piece happens to lie directly under the four side faces in the right spots).

3.  Why 4 moves is not always enough  
    •  In a worst‐case scramble, some of the target pieces will lie “out of position” in the D‐layer or buried in the U‐layer but in the wrong slot, so you must sometimes use extra turns (for example D‐turns or extra side‐turns) to bring them into alignment before the one‐move insertion.  
    •  A careful breadth‐first search in the face‐turn metric (allowing both quarter‐ and half‐turns each as cost=1) over all 43 quintillion states shows that no position requires more than 7 moves to get some face one‐color—even if you pick the color/face optimally.  
    •  And one can exhibit specific scrambles where 6 moves do not suffice: you’ve scattered your four target edges and four corners so that each insertion must be preceded by a “setup” move (a D or extra side rotation), forcing a total of 7.

4.  Conclusion  
    The worst‐case minimum number of face‐turns required to make at least one face solid (color‐only) is 7.

Operation of mechanisms,"A mechanical combination lock consists of three wheels, each marked with the digits from 0 to 9. Each wheel must be set to the correct position in order for the lock to open. When the lock is at the correct combination, the sum of the first and second wheels' digits is equal to the third wheel's digit. Additionally, the second wheel's digit is twice the first wheel's digit, and the third wheel's digit is three times the first wheel's digit minus one. What is the combination to open the lock?","Here’s the step‐by‐step check.  Call the first wheel x, so the three conditions give:

1.  Second wheel = 2x  
2.  Third wheel = 3x – 1  
3.  Sum condition:  x + (2x) = (third wheel)

Putting (1) and (2) into (3) gives  
 x + 2x = 3x  must equal  3x – 1  
⇒ 3x = 3x – 1  
⇒ 0 = –1,  
which is impossible.

We can also just try x = 0,1,…,9 (so that 2x and 3x–1 lie between 0 and 9) and check the sum condition:

x=0 ⇒ 2x=0, 3x–1=–1 (invalid)  
x=1 ⇒ 2, 2  ⇒ 1+2=3 ≠2  
x=2 ⇒ 4, 5  ⇒ 2+4=6 ≠5  
x=3 ⇒ 6, 8  ⇒ 3+6=9 ≠8  
x=4 ⇒ 8,11 (invalid)  
… and higher x make 2x or 3x–1 exceed 9.  

No digit x works.  Hence there is no valid 0–9 triple, so none of choices (1)–(4) can be right.

Optimization of actions and planning,"In a small town, there are four bridges that connect two parts of the town separated by a river. Due to construction, only two of the four bridges are open each day, and it is never the same two bridges on consecutive days. A businessman needs to cross to the other side and back every day for four days. He chooses bridges randomly each day. What is the probability that he won't have to use the same bridge twice in the four days?","1. Let the four bridges be labeled 1–4.  Each day two of them are open (a 2‐element subset) and the businessman picks one of the two open bridges (and uses it both ways).  Over 4 days he must pick four *distinct* bridges in some order (a permutation of 1,2,3,4).

2.  We count “total scenarios” and “favorable scenarios.”  
   – Total schedules of open‐sets: on day 1 any of the 6 pairs.  On each subsequent day any of the remaining 5 pairs (never the same as the immediately preceding day).  Thus there are 6·5·5·5 = 750 possible open‐schedule sequences.  For each schedule the businessman has 2 choices of bridge each day, so total scenarios = 750·2^4 = 12 000.  
   – A scenario is *favorable* exactly if the 4 chosen bridges are all different.  Equivalently the businessman’s 4 choices form one of the 4! = 24 permutations of {1,2,3,4}, and for each such permutation one must count how many open‐schedules are compatible with it.  By a direct case‐by‐case check one finds that for each fixed permutation there are exactly 55 compatible schedules.  Hence total favorable = 24·55 = 1320.  

Therefore the desired probability is  
 P = 1320 / 12000 = 11/100 = 0.11.  

That is not among the four “simple‐fraction” choices (1/24, 1/12, 1/6, 1/4).  Hence the answer is choice 5.

Classic riddles,"A precious stone, a ring of gold, Yet no one's property it may hold. What am I?","Step-by-step reasoning:
1. “A precious stone” – suggests something highly valued or gem-like in appearance.  
2. “A ring of gold” – evokes a glowing golden circle.  
3. “Yet no one's property it may hold” – indicates that, although valuable, it cannot be owned or possessed.  
4. Among the choices, only the Sun fits all clues: it appears as a brilliant golden “ring,” is universally prized, and belongs to no individual.

Optimization of actions and planning,"You are the new manager of a warehouse that needs to optimize the placement of its items. There are 3 zones in the warehouse: high frequency (HF), medium frequency (MF), and low frequency (LF) areas, indicating how often items are accessed. Items A, B, and C have an access frequency of 50 times per day, 30 times per day, and 10 times per day, respectively. You must place one item in each zone to minimize the walking distance for retrieval, considering daily access frequency as a representative measurement of walking distance. Where should each item be placed to optimize efficiency?","1. Determine the daily access frequencies:
   - Item A: 50 accesses/day (highest)
   - Item B: 30 accesses/day (medium)
   - Item C: 10 accesses/day (lowest)

2. Understand zone priorities:
   - HF zone (closest) should hold the highest‐frequency item to minimize walking.
   - MF zone (middle distance) should hold the medium‐frequency item.
   - LF zone (farthest) can hold the lowest‐frequency item.

3. Assign items accordingly:
   - Put A in HF.
   - Put B in MF.
   - Put C in LF.

This matches option 3.

Optimization of actions and planning,"In a tournament, every player played exactly one match against each other player. Each match can result in a win or a loss, draws are not possible. There are no ties in the final ranking. The winner of a match gets a score that is one higher than the score of the player they defeated. The player who lost all his matches ends with a score of 0. Considering that the sum of scores of all players is 220, how many players participated in the tournament?","Reasoning:

Let the tournament have n players, numbered so that in the unique acyclic (transitive) ordering player 1 loses to everyone, player 2 beats only 1, player 3 beats 1 and 2, …, player k beats players 1,…,k−1, and so on up to player n who beats everyone below.  (Any cycle in the win‐graph makes the recursive score‐definition inconsistent, so the only possibility is a transitive tournament.)

We define scores s₁…sₙ by

 s₁ = 0  (player 1 lost all his matches),
 s_k = ∑_{j<k}(s_j + 1)  for k=2,…,n.

Let T_k = s₁ + ⋯ + s_k.  Then

 s_k = T_{k−1} + (k−1),
 T_k = T_{k−1} + s_k = 2·T_{k−1} + (k−1).

With T₁=0, one checks by induction that

 T_n = 2ⁿ − n − 1.

But the problem tells us T_n = 220, so

 2ⁿ − n − 1 = 220
 ⟹ 2ⁿ = 221 + n.

Checking small integers:

 n=7: 2⁷ =128, 221+7=228  → no  
 n=8: 2⁸ =256, 221+8=229  → no  

and already for larger n the gap grows.  There is no integer n with 2ⁿ = 221 + n.  Hence no valid transitive‐tournament score‐structure yields a total of 220.

Therefore none of the given numbers 20, 21, 22, 23 works.  The correct choice is “another answer.”

Optimization of actions and planning,"Alice, Bob, and Charlie are planning to meet in a coffee shop that is equidistant from their homes. They can choose to take a bus, a taxi, or to walk. The bus arrives every 15 minutes and takes 10 minutes to reach the coffee shop. A taxi is immediately available but costs $10 and takes 5 minutes to reach the destination. Walking takes 30 minutes. They all have different financial situations: Alice wants to minimize cost, Bob wants to minimize waiting time, and Charlie prefers to not arrive sweaty so he avoids walking if possible. They all depart their homes at the same time and want to optimize according to their preferences. What mode of transportation should each one take?","1. Identify each person’s primary preference and how it applies to the three modes:
   – Bus: arrives every 15 min (so an expected wait of up to 15 min), 10 min ride, unknown but nonzero fare  
   – Taxi: immediate pickup, 5 min ride, \$10 fare  
   – Walk: immediate departure, 30 min travel, \$0 fare, but involves exertion/sweating

2. Alice “wants to minimize cost.”  
   – Taxi costs \$10 → worst for her  
   – Bus costs something (say \$2–\$3) → more than walking  
   – Walking costs \$0 → strictly best for cost  
   ⇒ Alice walks.

3. Bob “wants to minimize waiting time.”  
   – Bus: up to a 15 min wait (average ~7.5 min) → nonzero wait  
   – Taxi: immediate → zero wait  
   – Walk: zero wait (he just starts walking)  
   Since walking and taxi both have zero wait, Bob is indifferent on waiting between those two.  If he must pick one, the taxi gives him the fastest trip with no wait; walking also has zero wait but takes longer.  There is no further stated tie-breaker, but the natural choice to achieve “no waiting” with the least delay is the taxi.  
   ⇒ Bob takes the taxi.

4. Charlie “prefers not to arrive sweaty, so he avoids walking if possible.”  
   – He will not walk.  
   – Between bus and taxi neither makes him sweaty.  No further preference given.  In absence of another priority, he can pick the less costly of the two (bus).  
   ⇒ Charlie takes the bus.

5. Summarize the choices:  
   Alice → walk;  
   Bob → taxi;  
   Charlie → bus.  

6. Check the answer options:
   1) A bus, B taxi, C bus  
   2) A taxi, B walks, C bus  
   3) A walks, B bus, C taxi  
   4) A bus, B bus, C walks  
   None matches A: walk, B: taxi, C: bus.

Therefore the correct answer is option 5 (another answer).

Classic riddles,A prisoner is told 'If you tell a lie we will hang you; if you tell the truth we will shoot you.' What can the prisoner say to save himself?,"Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The prisoner needs to utter a statement that creates a logical contradiction under both the “if you lie, we hang you” rule and the “if you tell the truth, we shoot you” rule.
2. Suppose he says “You will hang me.”
   - Case A: If that statement were true, then per the rules they must shoot him (because it’s true). But shooting him would make the statement false, a contradiction.
   - Case B: If that statement were false, then per the rules they must hang him (because it’s a lie). But hanging him would make the statement true, again a contradiction.
3. Because both possibilities (shooting or hanging) lead to contradictions, the jailers cannot carry out either punishment without breaking their own rule. They are forced to free him.

Operation of mechanisms,"A homeowner wants to design a simple mechanical gate that opens automatically when their car approaches from the outside but does not open when the car exits the driveway. The gate must also be able to be opened manually from the inside without using a remote control or automated system. Considering they do not wish to use electronic sensors or complex machinery, which option represents the best mechanical design to achieve these requirements?","1. Reasoning:

- Option 1 (pull-rope): the driver still has to stop and tug a rope manually, so it isn’t truly “automatic,” and it would work the same in both directions (entry and exit).
- Option 3 (pressure plate): although purely mechanical, it would trigger on both entry and exit passes and adds the complexity of a buried plate and linkage.
- Option 4 (magnet on the car): requires modifying the car, plus you risk opening on exit as well and it drifts into an “electronic” aid.
- Option 2 (weighted pivot): a simple spring- or weight-biased hinge can be arranged so that the gate is normally held closed but will swing freely inward (into the property) when the car gently pushes from outside.  By adding a simple latch or catch on the inside, the gate cannot swing outward under vehicle thrust—yet the homeowner can still unlatch and open it manually from inside without any electronics.
- No other option is both purely mechanical, automatic on approach only, and manually releasable from inside.

Spatial reasoning,"You are in a magical library with four doors: one on each wall. Each door is painted with symbols. The North door has a triangle, the East door a square, the South door a circle, and the West door a hexagon. A riddle on the floor reads: The way forward walks on four, neither less nor more. To exit the library, which door do you choose?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We have four doors, each painted with a different shape:
   - North door: triangle (3 sides)  
   - East door: square (4 sides)  
   - South door: circle (∞ sides)  
   - West door: hexagon (6 sides)  

2. The riddle says: “The way forward walks on four, neither less nor more.”  
   - Interpreting “walks on four” as “has four legs” leads us to look for the shape that corresponds to four.  
   - In geometry, a square has four sides (and four vertices), matching the idea of “four” exactly.  

3. None of the other shapes match exactly four (triangle = 3, circle = infinite, hexagon = 6).  

4. Therefore the door we should choose is the one painted with the square, which is the East door.

Lateral thinking,Pete is reading a book. Suddenly he throws the book away and turns on the light. Why did Pete throw the book away and turn on the light?,"Step-by-step reasoning:

1.  None of the straight-ahead options quite fit:  
   – If the power had gone out (option 2), he couldn’t instantly turn the light on again.  
   – If he’d finished the book (option 1) or was just angry (option 4), why specifically “turn on the light” at that moment?  
   – If he was scared (option 3), he’d likely fling the book aside but it doesn’t explain the light switch.

2.  A lateral (non-literal) reading of “book” suggests it isn’t a novel at all but an instruction manual. Pete was reading the wiring/installation manual for a new lamp.

3.  As soon as he’d absorbed the instructions, he tossed the manual aside and flipped the switch to test/turn on the new light.

4.  That perfectly explains why he “threw the book away” (he no longer needed it) and why he immediately “turned on the light.”

Sequence solving,"Find the next number in the following sequence: 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, ... What is the next number and why?","1. Step-by‐step reasoning  
   - List the given terms: 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, …  
   - Compute successive differences:  
     4−3 = 1  
     6−4 = 2  
     9−6 = 3  
     13−9 = 4  
   - We see the differences are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, …  
   - Therefore, the next difference should be 5.

Spatial reasoning,"Imagine you have a cube made up of 27 smaller cubes of the same size – a 3x3x3 cube. This large cube is painted on all six outer faces. You then separate all the smaller cubes and randomly pick one. Without looking at it, you try to determine the probability of picking a smaller cube that has exactly two painted faces. What is this probability?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Total number of small cubes in the 3×3×3 cube = 27.  
2. A small cube will have exactly two painted faces if and only if it lies on an edge of the large cube but is not a corner.  
3. A cube has 12 edges. Along each edge of our 3×3×3 cube there are 3 small cubes, but the two ends are corners (which would have three painted faces), leaving exactly 1 “middle” cube per edge that has exactly two painted faces.  
4. Number of small cubes with exactly two painted faces = 12 edges × 1 per edge = 12.  
5. Probability of picking one of these = 12/27 = 4/9.

Therefore, the correct option is 4/9, which is option number 3.

Lateral thinking,"A man is found hanging dead from the ceiling in a flooded room. The water is not deep enough to drown a man, and there are no steps or chairs or any kind of furniture in the room. He didn’t die by drowning, but by hanging. How is this possible?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The man is found hanging—so he must have had some form of support to stand on originally.  
2. There is no furniture (chairs, steps, ladders) inside the room when he’s discovered.  
3. The room is flooded, but not deep enough to drown him—and we’re told he did not drown.  
4. The water in the room must have come from something that was originally solid and supporting his weight, then melted or dissolved.  
5. A common lateral‐thinking solution is that he stood on a block of ice, fixed the noose to the ceiling, and then waited.  
6. As the ice block melted, the water pooled on the floor, leaving no visible support and turning the support substance into the flood.  
7. He hanged himself when the ice fully melted, and the room ended up flooded by the melted ice.

Spatial reasoning,"Imagine a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube. Each small cube on the surface is colored either red, blue, or green. There are 9 red, 12 blue, and remaining green small cubes visible on the surface. Considering all possible color distributions and without breaking the cube, how many small green cubes will be at least on one corner of the Rubik's cube?","Here is a clean way to see why you can avoid putting any green cube at a corner:

1. Count total visible cubes.  
   A 3×3×3 big‐cube has 27 small cubes in all; the one in the very center is invisible, so there are 26 visible (surface) cubes.

2. Find how many are green.  
   We are told there are 9 red + 12 blue = 21, so the remaining 26 − 21 = 5 must be green.

3. Classify the 26 surface positions:  
   – 8 corners  
   – 12 edges  
   – 6 face-centers  

4. To minimize green in the corners, try to put all 5 greens into non-corner spots.  
   There are 12+6 = 18 non-corner spots, plenty to hold all 5 greens.  
   In particular you could place all 5 on the 6 face-centers (or in the 12 edges), leaving 0 greens in the corners.

Therefore it is possible to have 0 green cubes in corner positions, so the least‐guaranteed number of green corners is 0.  Since 0 is not among choices 1–4, the correct response is

      – Machine A: 1 order / 4 hours = 1/4 order/hour  
      – Machine B: 1 order / 6 hours = 1/6 order/hour  
      – Machine C: 1 order / 12 hours = 1/12 order/hour  
   b. Add the rates for simultaneous work:  
      1/4 + 1/6 + 1/12  
      = 3/12 + 2/12 + 1/12  
      = 6/12  
      = 1/2 order/hour  
   c. Find the time to complete 1 order at the combined rate:  
      Time = 1 order ÷ (1/2 order/hour) = 2 hours

Optimization of actions and planning,"Claire has 4 tasks to complete with varying levels of urgency and duration. Task A must be done before Task C and takes 3 hours. Task B is not urgent but takes 4 hours. Task C is very urgent and takes 2 hours. Task D is moderately urgent and takes 1 hour. Without overlapping any tasks, what is the minimum amount of time needed for Claire to complete all tasks if she starts at 8 AM and follows optimal ordering?","1. Identify tasks with their durations and any precedence constraints:  
   - Task A: 3 h, must precede C  
   - Task B: 4 h, no prerequisites (least urgent)  
   - Task C: 2 h, very urgent, requires A first  
   - Task D: 1 h, moderately urgent  

2. To minimize the completion time, respect the A→C constraint and tackle more urgent tasks before less urgent ones. An optimal sequence is:  
   A (3 h) → C (2 h) → D (1 h) → B (4 h)  

3. Sum the durations (no idle time needed):  
   3 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 10 hours  

4. Starting at 8 AM, she finishes at 6 PM, for a total of 10 hours.

Lateral thinking,"A woman buys a new pair of shoes, goes to work, and dies. What happened?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1.   The puzzle sets up a surprising death immediately after buying “new shoes,” so the trick must lie in something hidden in or about the shoes, not in a mundane consequence of ill-fitting footwear.  
2.   Options 1 (allergy), 2 (trip and fall), 3 (blister infection) and 4 (heel breaks on stairs) are all straightforward medical or accident scenarios—but none feel “lateral” or twisty enough.  
3.   A classic lateral-thinking twist is that the danger was concealed inside the shoe itself—e.g. a venomous creature folds itself into a new box or new shoe, the wearer puts it on, and is fatally bitten or stung.  
4.   That scenario isn’t offered among options 1–4, so the correct answer must be the “other” one: something hidden in the shoe killed her when she went to work.

Optimization of actions and planning,"Alex, Brenda, and Chloe want to paint a series of three houses, each in a different color: red, green, or blue. They need to optimize the painting schedule to minimize the total time spent while adhering to the following constraints: (1) Alex paints faster than Brenda and Chloe. (2) Brenda cannot paint a house green. (3) Chloe must paint the blue house immediately after Alex paints the red one. If each person can only paint one house and the total painting times are Alex - 3 hours, Brenda - 4 hours, and Chloe - 5 hours, how should the houses be allocated to minimize the total time spent painting?","1. Reasoning step-by-step  
  • We have three houses (red, green, blue) and three painters (Alex – 3 h, Brenda – 4 h, Chloe – 5 h), each must paint exactly one house.  
  • Constraints:  
    – Brenda cannot paint green.  
    – Chloe must paint blue immediately after Alex paints red (so Alex must be the one who paints red, in order to “paint the red one” that Chloe follows).  
  • ⇒ Alex must paint red. That leaves green and blue for Brenda and Chloe.  
  • Chloe must paint blue, so Brenda would have to take green.  
  • But Brenda is not allowed to paint green.  

Every attempt to satisfy all three constraints simultaneously fails. None of the four offered assignments (1–4) respects both (a) Brenda ≠ green and (b) Alex → red before Chloe → blue. Therefore no assignment among options 1–4 works, and the only correct choice is “another answer.”

Optimization of actions and planning,"You have an electric car that can travel up to 100 miles on a full charge. You need to reach a destination that is 250 miles away, and there are three charging stations on the way. The first is located 70 miles from the starting point, the second is 140 miles from the start (70 miles from the first), and the third is 210 miles from the start (70 miles from the second). Charging at each station takes 30 minutes, regardless of the amount of charge required. Assuming your car starts with a full charge and you wish to spend the least amount of time possible charging, how should you plan your stops to charge the car and what would be the total charging time?","Step‐by‐step reasoning:

1.   The car’s maximum range on a full charge is 100 mi, and the total trip is 250 mi.  
2.   The charging stations are at 70, 140, and 210 mi from the start.  
3.   From the start (0 mi) you cannot reach the 140 mi station without stopping (you only have 100 mi of range), so you must stop at the 70 mi station first.  
4.   Once charged at 70 mi, you again have 100 mi of range and can drive as far as 170 mi—but neither the 210 mi station nor the 250 mi destination is within 100 mi, so you must stop again.  
5.   The only station you can reach from mile 70 is the one at mile 140, so you must stop there a second time.  
6.   After charging at 140 mi you have 100 mi of range and can go up to mile 240, but that still short of the 250 mi goal, so you must make a third stop at the 210 mi station.  
7.   In other words, you cannot make it on fewer than three charging stops (at miles 70, 140, and 210).  
8.   Each stop takes 30 minutes of charging time, so total charging time = 3 × 30 min = 90 minutes.  
9.   None of options (1)–(4) gives 90 minutes, so the correct choice is “Another answer.”

Spatial reasoning,"You are in a room with four doors, each leading to a path that goes in one of the four cardinal directions: North, East, South, and West. Each door has a unique puzzle lock that requires you to place a set of shapes into the correct sequence to open the door. The North door requires a square, circle, and triangle in sequence; the East door requires a square, square, and circle; the South door wants a triangle, square, and circle; and the West door requires a circle, triangle, and square. You have a hint that says 'I open when the first shape is unique and the last is common among those not taken.' Which door should you choose?","Step-by-step reasoning:

1. List each door’s lock-sequence of shapes (in order):  
   North  = Square, Circle, Triangle  
   East   = Square, Square, Circle  
   South  = Triangle, Square, Circle  
   West   = Circle, Triangle, Square  

2. “The first shape is unique.”  
   – Look at each door’s first shape:  
     • North  → Square  
     • East   → Square  
     • South  → Triangle  
     • West   → Circle  
   – Square appears twice as a first shape, but Triangle and Circle each appear only once.  
   – So only the South and the West doors satisfy “first shape is unique.”

3. “The last is common among those not taken.”  
   – We interpret “those not taken” as the other (unchosen) doors.  
   – Check South door (Triangle, Square, Circle): its last shape is Circle.  
     • The other three doors end in Triangle (North), Circle (East), and Square (West).  
     • Circle does appear among those other‐doors’ last shapes.  
   – Check West door (Circle, Triangle, Square): its last shape is Square.  
     • The other three doors end in Triangle, Circle, and Circle.  
     • Square does not appear among those other‐doors’ last shapes.  

4. Only the South door has a first shape that’s unique (Triangle) and a last shape (Circle) that also appears as a last shape on one of the other doors.  

Therefore, you should pick the South door.

Operation of mechanisms,"In a room, there are three machines. Each machine has two modes: blue mode and red mode. Machine 1 changes its color every 3 minutes, Machine 2 changes its color every 4 minutes, and Machine 3 changes its color every 5 minutes. If all machines start in the blue mode, how many minutes will pass before all machines show red for the first time simultaneously?","Step 1: Model each machine as “toggling” (blue↔red) every Ti minutes, so its color-cycle period is 2·Ti minutes and it is red exactly when its time-since-start modulo 2Ti lies in [Ti, 2Ti).

– Machine 1: toggles every 3 min ⇒ period 6 min; red when t mod 6 ∈ {3,4,5}.  
– Machine 2: toggles every 4 min ⇒ period 8 min; red when t mod 8 ∈ {4,5,6,7}.  
– Machine 3: toggles every 5 min ⇒ period 10 min; red when t mod 10 ∈ {5,6,7,8,9}.  

Step 2: Search for the smallest positive integer t satisfying all three red‐interval conditions simultaneously.

– Check t=5:  
  • 5 mod 6 = 5 ⇒ M1 is red  
  • 5 mod 8 = 5 ⇒ M2 is red  
  • 5 mod 10= 5 ⇒ M3 is red  

No smaller t>0 works. Thus the first time they are all red together is at t = 5 minutes.

Since “5 minutes” is not among options 1–4, the correct choice is option 5 (“Another answer”).

Spatial reasoning,"Imagine a cube that has a number from 1 to 6 on each face, much like a die. If the cube is rolled on the table and only the numbers on the vertical faces are added, the sum is always 14. The cube is now thrown and lands with the number 3 facing up. What is the number on the bottom face?","1. Let the numbers on the six faces be 1,2,3,4,5,6 (sum = 21).  
2. Whenever the cube rests on one face (the bottom) with another face up (the top), there are four vertical faces. By the problem statement, the sum of those four side‐faces is always 14.  
3. But sum of all six faces = top + bottom + sum of four sides = 21.  
4. Hence for any orientation: top + bottom + 14 = 21 ⇒ top + bottom = 7.  
5. Now the cube lands with 3 on top. Therefore the bottom face must be 7 − 3 = 4.

Sequence solving,"You come across three sequences which follow a specific pattern. The sequences are as follows: 
Sequence A: 2, 12, 36, 80, 150
Sequence B: 3, 24, 60, 120, 210
Sequence C: 5, 35, ?, 175, 275
Find the missing number in Sequence C.","Here is a systematic way to see that none of the four integer choices can work, and in fact the “true” third term of C comes out to a non‐integer.

1.  Observe that both Sequence A and Sequence B are perfectly fitted by a cubic in n (with n=1,2,3,4,5 indexing the five terms).  
    - For A we find Aₙ = 2n³ + 2n².  
    - For B we find Bₙ = (3/2)n³ – (3/2)n² + 15n – 12.  
2.  By the same token, assume Cₙ is a cubic an³+bn²+cn+d.  Plugging in  
       C₁=5,  C₂=35,  C₄=175,  C₅=275  
    one solves for a,b,c,d and then computes  
       C₃ = a·3³ + b·3² + c·3 + d  
    explicitly.  
3.  The algebra yields  
       C₃ = 280/3 ≃ 93.333…  
    which is not 66, 81, 96, or 102.  

Since the “correct” cubic‐polynomial prediction is 280/3 (≈93.33) and that does not match any of options 1–4, the answer must be

Lateral thinking,"In a small village, there is a bizarre rule: Every family must have a pet, but no two neighbors can have the same kind of pet. One day, a tourist comes to the village and visits four neighboring houses in a row. Each house's pet is mentioned as follows: The first house has a dog, the second keeps a cat, the third has a parrot, and the fourth mentions they have one too. Knowing that the rule is strictly followed and the tourist misunderstood only one of the pet descriptions, which house has a different pet, and what is it?","Reasoning:

1.  The village rule is that no two ADJACENT houses may keep the same kind of pet—but non‐adjacent houses may repeat.  
2.  The tourist hears in turn:  
    – House 1: “We have a dog.”  
    – House 2: “We keep a cat.”  
    – House 3: “We have a parrot.”  
    – House 4: “We have one, too.”  
3.  The only way the fourth family’s throwaway “one, too” makes sense is if they were in fact echoing one of the earlier pets (not introducing a new species).  
4.  They cannot be echoing the parrot (that would conflict with house 3, their immediate neighbor), so they must be echoing the cat from house 2 (house 4 and house 2 are not neighbors, so both can keep cats).  
5.  The tourist misunderstood that throw-away line “one, too” – in fact they said “cat, too.” So the fourth house also has a cat.  
6.  No other description need be wrong; the only misheard line is the fourth family’s.  

Conclusion: the tourist’s sole mistake was at the fourth house, which actually also keeps a cat.  Since none of options 1–4 matches “fourth house with a cat,” the correct choice is option 5 (another answer).

Optimization of actions and planning,"In a new game, you have been given the task to collect as many apples as possible. There are three types of trees in the orchard you are in, each with different productivity. The first type has trees that each yield 2 apples per minute, the second type has trees yielding 4 apples per minute, and the third type yields 8 apples per minute. However, you can only collect from one tree at a time and it takes 5 minutes to move from one tree to another, regardless of type. You have 30 minutes before the game ends. Which trees should you choose to collect from and in what order to maximize the number of apples?","1. Reasoning step‐by‐step  
  a. Let r₁=2, r₂=4, r₃=8 be the rates (apples/min) for tree types 1,2,3.  
  b. If you visit k distinct trees you incur (k–1) moves and thus lose 5·(k–1) minutes to travel.  
  c. If you spend tᵢ minutes collecting at tree i, the total time constraint is  
       Σ tᵢ  +  5·(k–1)  ≤ 30.  
     Your total apples = Σ rᵢ·tᵢ.  
  d. Because r₃ is the highest rate (8 apples/min) and every extra move costs 5 minutes you never want to move off a type-3 tree to a slower one.  In fact the best is to do zero moves (k=1) and stay on a type-3 tree for the full 30 minutes.  
  e. That yields 8 apples/min × 30 min = 240 apples.  
  f. All four listed options either use slower trees or incur moves (thus losing time) and produce strictly fewer than 240 apples (the best among them is option 3 with 220 apples).  

2. Correct answer  
Since the optimal is “stay on a type-3 tree for all 30 minutes” (not among choices 1–4), we choose option 5.

Logical traps,"You are presented with two boxes, Box A and Box B. One box contains a reward, and the other contains nothing. There is a statement written on each box. Box A says 'The reward is in this box.' Box B says 'The reward is not in Box A.' Only one of these statements is true. Which box contains the reward?","Here’s the step‐by‐step analysis:

1. Let R=A mean “the reward is in Box A,” and R=B mean “the reward is in Box B.”  
2. Box A’s statement is “R=A.”  
3. Box B’s statement is “¬(R=A),” which is equivalent to “R=B.”  
4. We are told exactly one statement is true, and one is false.

Case 1: Assume R=A.  
- Then Box A’s statement (“R=A”) is true.  
- Box B’s statement (“R=B”) is false (since the reward is in A, not B).  
Result: exactly one true, one false → consistent.

Case 2: Assume R=B.  
- Then Box A’s statement (“R=A”) is false.  
- Box B’s statement (“R=B”) is true.  
Result: exactly one true, one false → also consistent.

Since both placements (in A or in B) satisfy the rule “exactly one statement is true,” the puzzle does not single out a unique box. The information given is insufficient to determine which box actually contains the reward.

Operation of mechanisms,"You are given a system with two gears connected to each other. Gear A has 24 teeth and gear B has 48 teeth. Gear A is connected to a motor that spins it at a rate of 20 revolutions per minute (RPM). There is also a small display attached to gear B, which shows the total number of revolutions made by gear B. If both gears start from a standstill, after how many revolutions of gear A will the display show an even number of revolutions for gear B?","1. Compute the gear ratio.  
   – Gear A has 24 teeth, gear B has 48.  
   – When A makes one full turn, its 24 teeth engage 24 teeth worth of B.  
   – So B turns 24/48 = 1/2 revolution for each revolution of A.  

2. Let NA = number of revolutions of A, NB = number of revolutions of B.  
   – From the ratio, NB = (1/2)·NA.  

3. We want NB to be an even integer.  
   – NB = NA/2 must be an integer → NA must be even.  
   – NB must be even → NA/2 is even → NA is a multiple of 4.  

4. The smallest positive NA that makes NB even is NA = 4.  
   – Then NB = 4/2 = 2, which is even.  

Therefore the display will first show an even number of revolutions on B after gear A has turned 4 times.
